# Join Us
## Introduction
Welcome to this small policy on Joining the Arabian vACC!

In this section, you will learn about the differences between a vACC, a Division, and a Region, as well as how to join us with the appropriate Division and Region to become a resident controller. If you are interested in joining us as a visiting controller, please refer to the visiting controller section of this policy.

The VATSIM Network is divided into vACCs, Divisions, and Regions. An example is provided below:

- **The Arabian vACC (ACCARB)** is a vACC of the Middle East & North Africa Division (VATMENA).
- **The Middle East & North Africa Division (VATMENA)** is a Division of the Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region.
- **Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region (VATEMEA)** is a Region of VATSIM.

## Current vACC/Division/Region Assigment
To proceed with the next sections of this policy, you must first determine your current assignment in terms of vACC, Division, and Region. You can find this information by checking your [myVATSIM profile](https://my.vatsim.net/profile) and looking at the **"Region - Division - Subdivision"** field.

!!! Warning
    Please ensure you are completely certain about your desired assignment on the VATSIM Network for your Air Traffic Controller training! Random transfers will incur a 90-day cooldown in accordance with the VATSIM Transfer & Visiting Controller policy that the vACC and Division adhere to. All transfers are managed by volunteers who respond on a daily basis. Repeatedly contacting membership staff for updates on your transfer will not speed up the process!

### Region Assignment
After checking your myVATSIM profile and you are not within the Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region please follow the following steps:

1. Head over to the [myVATSIM Region transfer page](https://my.vatsim.net/user/region)</li>
2. Select "Europe, Middle East, and Africa" as your new Region</li>
3. Select "Middle East & North Africa" as your new Division</li>

!!! Info
    Regional transfers are not managed by the vACC or Division Membership Departments and are outside of our control. Please refrain from messaging us about the status of your transfer, as we are not responsible for these processes. Remember that the VATSIM Transfer & Visiting Controller policy applies, and any approved transfers will be subject to a 90-day cooldown period before you can submit another transfer request.

### Division Assignment
If you are currently in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region but not within the Middle East & North Africa Division, please follow these steps:

1. Join the Middle East & North Africa Discord server via [community.vatsim.net](https://community.vatsim.net/). Make sure your VATSIM account is linked to ensure your Discord roles are correctly assigned!
2. Send a private message to the MENA Support Bot, which can be found on the Middle East & North Africa Discord server.
