# 1.	Application of Separation Minima
## 1.1	General provisions
Separation shall at all times be ensured in accordance with the appropriate ICAO or eWTS wake turbulence minima, however, this must not come at the cost of efficiency.

All Arabian vACC sector files includes a timer implemented within Ground Radar Plugin in order to track the time between aircraft. 

It must be noted, however, that controllers must at all times strive to achieve the most efficient departure order that will require the least amount of separation to be applied.

Lookup tables are provided to allow controllers to determine the required separation more easily.

For any combination of wake turbulence categories that are not listed in the tables below, wake turbulence separation is not required.

## 1.2	Applicability
### 1.2.1	Time-based separation
Time based wake turbulence separation minima shall be applied for departing traffic in the following cases:

- When aircraft are departing full length from the same runway;
- When aircraft departing from the same point on a parallel runway separated by less than 760 m;
- When aircraft are departing from an intermediate part of the runway following a full length take off;
- When aircraft are departing from an intermediate part of a parallel runway separated by less than 760m;
- If the flight paths are expected to cross

### 1.2.2	Distance-based separation
Distance based wake turbulence separation minima shall be applied when aircraft are on approach to landing in the following cases:

- On approach to the same runway
- On approach to a dependent parallel runway
- If the flight path of the trailing aircraft is expected to cross within 1000 ft below of the leading aircraft.
- 
If at any time separation reduces to below the specified minima with no other option available, the succeeding aircraft must be instructed to go around.

Where no wake turbulence separation minima exist (eg. SUPER following SUPER), minimum radar separation of 2.5 NM shall be applied. Where the conditions for the application of this separation are not met (e.g. contaminated runway), minimum separation of 3.0 NM shall be applied.

### 1.3	Timing technique
Controllers shall apply the appropriate time-based separation using the following technique to maximise airport departure rate and therefore minimise the appropriate average departure delay.

1.	The timing shall commence when the leading aircraft commences its take-off roll on the runway. 
2.	The take-off clearance for the trailing aircraft shall be given with 15 to 20 seconds remaining of the elapsed time. If this occurs when the leading aircraft has not yet crossed the departure threshold, traffic information shall be provided.

Controllers are reminded that RRSM shall not be applied when there is a wake turbulence separation requirement and 2 minutes minimum separation for aircraft on the same SID still applies.
