# 3. Position Specific Phraseology
## 3.1 Clearance delivery
### 3.1.1 Clearances and read back requirements
Controller should pass a clearance considering that the pilot may need to write it down.

Aircraft clearances should be passed prior to start-up and, in any case, controllers should avoid passing a clearance during high cockpit workload periods, or when an aircraft is lining up or taking off.

An ATC route clearance is not an instruction to take off or enter an active runway. The word “TAKE-OFF” is used only when an aircraft is cleared for take-off, or when cancelling a take-off clearance. At other times, the word “DEPARTURE” or “AIRBORNE” shall be used.

A pilot is required to acknowledge receipt of the following ATC clearances, information, or instruction by a full readback followed by the aircraft callsign:

- ATC route, taxi, approach and departure clearances and amendments thereto
- Clearances to VFR aircraft to operate within controlled airspace, to enter or vacate the circuit
- Clearances and instructions to enter, land on, take off from, hold short of, cross and backtrack on any runway
- Runway in use, altimeter settings, SSR codes, level instructions, heading and speed instructions, transition levels and frequency change instructions whether these have been issued by the controller or contained in an ATIS broadcast
- Instructions to push back and taxi on the movement area
- Conditional clearances

Clearances from clearance delivery controllers should include:

- Aircraft callsign
- Confirmation of destination
- Assigned departure (RNAV SID/RNAV RADAR DEPARTURE/Omnidirectional instructions)
- Assigned runway
- Initial altitude
- Assigned squawk code

### 3.1.2 Squawk code assignment
Controllers shall actively listen to and insist upon a correct read back to ascertain that the clearance or instruction has been correctly acknowledged and shall take immediate action to correct any discrepancies revealed by the read back or lack thereof. 

#### 3.1.2.1 General (Single Runway)
!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 587, CLEARED TO AMSTERDAM VIA SENPA2F, MAINTAIN ALTITUDE 4000 FEET, SQUAWK 0534."

    **Pilot**: "CLEARED TO AMSTERDAM VIA SENPA2F, MAINTAIN 4000FT, SQUAWK 0534, EMIRATES 587"

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 587, [READBACK] CORRECT, INFORMATION CHARLIE, QNH 1018, REPORT READY FOR PUSH AND START."

    **Pilot**: "INFORMATION CHARLIE, QNH 1018, WILCO, EMIRATES 587."

#### 3.1.2.2 General (Dual Runway)
!!! example
    **Controller**: "ETIHAD 587, CLEARED TO TASHKENT VIA TULON1P, RUNWAY 31R, MAINTAIN ALTITUDE 4000 FEET, SQUAWK 0534."

    **Pilot**: "CLEARED TO TASHKENT VIA TULON1P, RUNWAY31R, MAINTAIN 4000FT, SQUAWK 0534, ETIHAD 587"

    **Controller**: "ETIHAD 587, [READBACK] CORRECT, INFORMATION CHARLIE, QNH 1018, REPORT READY FOR PUSH AND START."

    **Pilot**: "INFORMATION CHARLIE, QNH 1018, WILCO, ETIHAD 587."

#### 3.1.2.3 Dubai Specific
!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 587, CLEARED TO AMSTERDAM VIA SENPA2F, MAINTAIN ALTITUDE 4000 FEET, SQUAWK 0534."

    **Pilot**: "CLEARED TO AMSTERDAM VIA SENPA2F, MAINTAIN 4000FT, SQUAWK 0534, EMIRATES 587"

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 587, [READBACK] CORRECT, INFORMATION CHARLIE, QNH 1018, REPORT READY FOR PUSH AND START."

    **Pilot**: "INFORMATION CHARLIE, QNH 1018, WILCO, EMIRATES 587."

#### 3.1.2.1 Doha Specific
!!! example
    **Controller**: "QATARI 35B, CLEARED TO MUNICH, TULUB1W DEPARTURE, CLIMB VIA THE SID TO ALTITUDE 4000 FEET, SQUAWK 2615."

    **Pilot**: "CLEARED TO MUNICH, TULUB1W DEPARTURE, CLIMB VIA THE SID TO ALTITUDE 4000 FEET, SQUAWK 2615, QATARI 35B"

    **Controller**: "QATARI 35B, [READBACK] CORRECT, INFORMATION X-RAY, QNH 1013, REPORT READY FOR PUSH AND START."

    **Pilot**: "INFORMATION X-RAY, QNH 1015, WILCO, QATARI 35B."

It is important to note that the runway is not specified in the clearance at Doha. This is due to the SIDs being runway dependent. 

### 3.1.3 Correct readback
If the aircrafts readback was correct, the clearance delivery controller should acknowledge this with the phrase “READBACK CORRECT” and proceed to pass across details of active ATIS letter along with local QNH.

### 3.1.4 Incorrect readback
If an aircraft readback is incorrect, the controller will transmit “NEGATIVE, I SAY AGAIN” followed by the correct version.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 587, SQUAWK 0535."

    **Pilot**: "SQUAWK 587, EMIRATES 587"

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 587, NEGATIVE I SAY AGAIN SQUAWK 0535."

    **Pilot**: "SQUAWK 0535, EMIRATES 587."

### 3.1.5 Aircraft unable an instruction
If there is a doubt as to whether a pilot can comply with an ATC clearance or instruction, the controller may follow the clearance or instruction by the phrase “IF UNABLE”, and subsequently offer an alternative. If at any time a pilot receives a clearance or instruction which cannot be complied with, that pilot shall advise the controller using the phrase “UNABLE” and give the reasons. 

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "UNABLE SID, DUE AIRCRAFT EQUIPMENT, REQUEST OMNIDIRECTIONAL DEPARTURE, IFLY 387"

    **Controller**: "IFLY 587, ROGER, EXPECT OMNIDIRECTIONAL DEPARTURE."

### 3.1.6 Reclearance
When an ATC route clearance is changed for ATC reasons or following an aircraft request, instructions will be passed in the form of a reclearance.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "QATARI 587, RECLEARED VIA TULUB1W, REST OF CLEARANCE REMAINS UNCHANGED."

    **Pilot**: "ROGER TULUB1W, REST OF CLEARANCE REMAINS UNCHANGED, QATARI 587"

    **Controller**: "ETIHAD 587, NEW CRUSING LEVEL FL340."

    **Pilot**: "ROGER NEW CRUISING LEVEL FL340, ETIHAD 587."

### 3.1.7 Omnidirectional or radar departures
Some aircraft may be unable to fly an RNAV SID, or simply may not have the latest RNAV SIDs installed into their aircraft. In this situation, controllers shall issue an omnidirectional departure. This includes:

- The departure runway
- A heading to fly after departure (normally runway heading)
- The altitude to climb to after departure
- Assigned squawk code

!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 587, CLEARED TO BANGALORE VIA OMNIDIRECTIONAL DEPARTURE, MAINTAIN RUNWAY HEADING, CLIMB TO ALTITUDE 4000FT, SQUAWK 0543."

    **Pilot**: "CLEAERED TO BANGALORE VIA OMNIDIRECTIONAL DEPARTURE, MAINTAIN RUNWAY HEADING, CLIMB TO ALTITUDE 4000FT, SQUAWK 0543, EMIRATES 587."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 587, [READBACK] CORRECT, INFORMATION F, QNH1015, REPORT READY FOR PUSH AND START."

    **Pilot**: “INFORMATION A, QNH1015, WILCO, EMIRATES 587.”

## 3.2 Ground movement control
### 3.2.1 Pushback clearance
At most aerodromes, including those in the Arabian FIRs, aircraft are parked with the nose facing the terminal and require a pushback before taxi for departure. Requests for pushback are made using local aerodrome specific ground movement procedures. At certain aerodromes the taxiway to push onto may be mentioned.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "MUSCAT GROUND, OMAN AIR 587, STAND 303, REQUEST PUSH AND START."

    **Controller**: "OMAN AIR 587, STAND 303, PUSH AND START APPROVED, FACE TO THE EAST."

    **Pilot**: "STAND 303, PUSH AND START APPROVED, FACE TO THE EAST, OMAN AIR 587."

### 3.2.2 Taxi clearance
The pilot of the aircraft is required to state their location when either requesting to start engines, pushback or when requesting taxi clearance.

When an aircraft wishes to depart from a runway other than that nominated as in use, IFR flights must make this request prior to starting, and VFR aircraft must include this in the request for taxi clearance.

When an aircraft requires a reduced length for take-off, or a backtrack from a runway entry point, this request must be included in the request for taxi clearance, along with any other intentions of a pilot which are significant to ATC.

Taxi instructions issued by a controller will always contain a clearance limit, which is the point at which the aircraft must stop unless further permission to proceed is given. The clearance limit may not necessarily be a position from which an aircraft can enter the runway for departure, or enter the apron, but may be some other position on the aerodrome depending on prevailing circumstances. Taxi instructions may also include a taxi route.

When a taxi clearance contains a taxi limit beyond a runway, it shall contain either an explicit clearance to cross, or an instruction to hold short of that runway.

**Note**: *When a clearance includes the instruction “report runway vacated” the runway is vacated when the entire aircraft is beyond the relevant runway holding position.*

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "HAMAD GROUND, QATARI 587, REQUEST TAXI."

    **Controller**: "QATARI 587, TAXI VIA E, C, A2, HOLD SHORT RUNWAY 34R."

    **Pilot**: "TAXI VIA E, C, A2, HOLD SHORT RUNWAY 34R, QATARI 587."

### 3.2.3 Conditional clearance
In certain situations, it is beneficial for controllers to issue a conditional clearance to aircraft for example using “BEHIND PASSING EGYPTAIR BOEING 777 FROM LEFT TO RIGHT”.

A conditional clearance should always include:

- Aircraft callsign
- The condition of the request
- The clearance
- A brief reiteration of the condition

!!! example
    **Controller**: "FEDEX 12, BEHIND THE EMIRATES BOEING 777, PASSING LEFT TO RIGHT, STAND E14, PUSH AND START APPROVED, FACE EAST, BEHIND."

    **Pilot**: "BEHIND THE EMIRATES BOEING 777, PASSING LEFT TO RIGHT, STAND E14, PUSH AND START APPROVED, FACE EAST, FEDEX12."

A conditional clearance may also be used for other ATS positions such as TWR.

## 3.3 Aerodrome Control
### 3.3.1 General
In the Arabian FIRs, some aerodromes may have separate ground and tower frequencies. Controllers should bear in mind their designated areas of responsibility and perform handoffs accordingly. Care should be taken to ensure that the phraseology used during the taxi manoeuvre cannot be interpreted as a clearance to enter or take off from the runway.

### 3.3.2 Take-off clearance
A take-off clearance shall be issued separately from any other clearance.

When several runways are in use and there is any possibility that confusion may arise as to the runway to be used, the runway designator shall be stated in the take-off clearance. 

Surface wind shall be passed if there is a significant difference to that which has already been passed.

A take-off clearance should only include the runway holding point if the aircraft is not already situated at that runway holding point.

#### 3.3.2.1 General
!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 587, FROM M13A [SURFACE] WIND, 300 DEGREES, 18 KNOTS, RUNWAY 30R, CLEARED FOR TAKE-OFF."

    **Pilot**: "FROM M13A, RUNWAY 30R, CLEARED FOR TAKE-OFF, EMIRATES 587."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 587, [SURFACE] WIND, 300 DEGREES, 18 KNOTS, RUNWAY 30R, CLEARED FOR TAKE-OFF."

    **Pilot**: "RUNWAY 30R, CLEARED FOR TAKE-OFF, EMIRATES 587."

**Note**: *the pilot should not readback the surface winds, nor should the controller expect a readback of this.*

Except in cases of emergency controllers should not transmit to an aircraft in the process of taking off and during the early stage of climb.

For traffic reasons it may be necessary for the aircraft to take off immediately after lining up.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 587, ARE YOU READY FOR IMMEDIATE DEPARTURE?"

    **Pilot**: "AFFIRM, EMIRATES 587."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 587, [SURFACE] WIND, 300 DEGREES, 18 KNOTS, RUNWAY 30R, CLEARED IMMEDIATE TAKE-OFF."

    **Pilot**: "RUNWAY 30R, CLEARED IMMEDIATE TAKE-OFF, EMIRATES 587."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 587, LINE UP RUNWAY 30R, BE READY FOR IMMEDIATE DEPARTURE"

    **Pilot**: "LINE UP RUNWAY 30R, WE ARE READY FOR IMMEDIATE DEPARTURE, EMIRATES 587."

During low visibility operations the controller may request the pilot to report when airborne.

#### 3.3.2.2 Doha Specific
In the take-off clearance the departure frequency is issued.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "QATARI 587, AIRBORNE CONTACT DOHA RADAR ON 121.1, FROM A2 [SURFACE] WIND, 300 DEGREES, 18 KNOTS, RUNWAY 34R, CLEARED FOR TAKE-OFF."

    **Pilot**: "AIRBORNE CONTACT DOHA RADAR ON 121.1, FROM A2, RUNWAY 34R, CLEARED FOR TAKE-OFF, QATARI 587."

    **Controller**: "QATARI 587, AIRBORNE CONTACT DOHA RADAR ON 121.1, [SURFACE] WIND, 300 DEGREES, 18 KNOTS, RUNWAY 34R, CLEARED FOR TAKE-OFF."

    **Pilot**: "AIRBORNE CONTACT DOHA RADAR ON 121.1, RUNWAY 34R, CLEARED FOR TAKE-OFF, QATARI 587."

### 3.3.3 Cancelling take-off clearance
Due to unexpected traffic developments or a departing aircraft taking longer to take off than anticipated it is occasionally necessary to cancel the take-off clearance or quickly free the runway for landing traffic. In this situation the pilot must acknowledge the instruction with callsign and intentions.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "SPEEDBIRD 106, TAKE OFF IMMEDIATELY OR HOLD SHORT OF RUNWAY"

    **Pilot**: "HOLDING SHORT, SPEEDBIRD 106"

    **Controller**: "SPEEDBIRD 106, TAKE-OFF IMMEDIATELY OR VACATE RUNWAY"

    **Pilot**: "TAKING OFF, SPEEDBIRD 106."

    **Controller**: "PQR, HOLD POSITION, CANCEL TAKE-OFF CLEARANCE, I SAY AGAIN CANCEL TAKE-OFF DUE <Reason> ACKNOWLEDGE."

    **Pilot**: "HOLDING/STOPPING, PQR."

When a pilot abandons the take-off manoeuvre, the control tower should be informed as soon as practicable, and assistance or taxi instructions should be requested as required.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "KLM 428, STOPPING."

    **Controller**: “KLM428, ROGER” OR “KLM428, ROGER, DO YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE.”

    **Pilot**: "REQUEST RETURN TO STAND, KLM428."

    **Controller**: "KLM428, ROGER, TAXI FIRST LEFT, CONTACT GROUND 118.350."

    **Pilot**: "FIRST LEFT AND CONTACT GROUND 118.350, KLM428."

### 3.3.4 RRSM traffic information
When reduced runway separation minima is being applied, controllers shall pass traffic information about the preceding aircraft.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "KLM428, TRAFFIC IS AN EMIRATES BOEING 777 VACATING RUNWAY 30L AHEAD, SURFACE WIND 300 DEGREES 12 KNOTS, RUNWAY 30L, CLEARED TO LAND."

    **Pilot**: “COPY TRAFFIC, RUNWAY 30L, CLEARED TO LAND, KLM428.”

### 3.3.5 VFR departures
Departure clearances may include a CTR (control zone) sector, a VFR departure procedure or plain language instructions. 

Aircraft must, on leaving the aerodrome traffic circuit, enter and remain within the lateral limits of any sector in the clearance, or follow the assigned route specified in the VFR Departure Procedure or the clearance. 

Altitude instructions are included in published VFR Departure Procedures.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "A6-BAC, LEAVE THE DUBAI CONTROL ZONE VIA VR6, AT 1000FT VFR, SQUAWK XXXX."

    **Pilot**: “LEAVE THE DUBAI CONTROL ZONE VIA VR6, AT 1000FT VFR, SQUAWK XXXX, A6-BAC”

### 3.3.6 VFR Circuits
Occasionally aircraft may wish to join and remain in the circuit. Aircraft may perform multiple approaches and landings known as a “touch and go”.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "A6-CYI, AFTER DEPARTURE RUNWAY 30L, ENTER LEFT HAND CIRCUIT AT ALTITUDE 1000FT VFR, SQUAWK 6015."

    **Pilot**: “AFTER DEPARTURE RUNWAY 30L ENTER LEFT HAND CIRCUIT AT ALTITUDE 1000FT, SQUAWK 6015, A6-CYI."

    **Controller**: "A6-CYI, EXTEND DOWNWIND NUMBER TWO, FOLLOW CHEROKEE FOUR MILES FINAL."

    **Pilot**: “EXTENDING DOWNWIND NUMBER TWO, TRAFFIC IN SIGHT, A6-CYI."

    **Controller**: "A6-CYI, ORBIT RIGHT REPORT COMPLETE."

    **Pilot**: “ORBITING RIGHT, WILCO, A6-CYI."

    **Controller**: "A6-CYI, NUMBER ONE MAKE SHORT APPROACH CHEROKEE SIX MILES FINAL."

    **Pilot**: “SHORT APPROACH TRAFFIC IN SIGHT, A6-CYI."

### 3.3.7 VFR arrivals
The initial call to aerodrome control requesting clearance to enter a CTR (control zone) must be made in sufficient time to allow the controller to assess the VFR and IFR traffic situation and issue a clearance prior to the aircraft reaching the CTR (control zone) boundary. Pilots must be advised if they are to operate in special VFR conditions (SVFR).

Arrival clearances may include a CTR (control zone) sector, a VFR Arrival Procedure, plain language instructions, or circuit joining instructions. Aircraft must remain within the lateral limits of any sector in the clearance, or follow the assigned route specified in the VFR Arrival Procedure or the clearance and comply with circuit joining and reporting instructions. Altitude instructions are included in the VFR arrival clearance.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: “DUBAI TOWER, A6-EFR, GOOD DAY."

    **Controller**: "A6-EFR, DUBAI TOWER [PASS YOUR MESSAGE OR STAND BY]."

    **Pilot**: “AFR, COUNTRY CLUB 1500 FEET, INFORMATION TANGO, QNH 1018, FOR LANDING, POB THREE."

    **Controller**: "AFR, ENTER CONTROL ZONE VIA VL1, 1500 FEET OR BELOW, HOLD AT GARHOUD BRIDGE."

    **Pilot**: “ENTER CONTROL ZONE VIA VL1, 1500 FEET OR BELOW, HOLD AT GARHOUD AFR."

Requests for circuit joining instructions should be issued early enough to allow for a planned entry in the circuit taking other traffic into account.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: “DUBAI TOWER, A6-CYI, CESSNA 182 10 MILES SOUTH 1500FT FOR LANDING."

    **Controller**: "A6-CYI, DUBAI TOWER [ENTER CONTROL ZONE VIA…], JOIN RIGHT HAND DOWNWIND RUNWAY 30L, TRAFFIC IS A BOEING 737 ON DOWNWIND, REPORT IN SIGHT."

    **Pilot**: “RIGHT HAND RUNWAY 30L, BOEING 737 IN SIGHT, A6-CYI."

    **Controller**: "A6-CYI, NUMBER TWO FOLLOW THE BOEING 737, CAUTION WAKE TURBULENCE."

    **Pilot**: “NUMBER TWO FOLLOWING BOEING 737, CAUTION COPIED, A6-CYI."

### 3.3.8 Circuit reporting points
The pilot having joined the traffic circuit makes routine reports as required by the Arabian FIRs procedures.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: “DOWNWIND RUNWAY 30L, FOR TOUCH AND GO, A6-CYI."

    **Controller**: "A6-CYI, TRAFFIC IS BOEING 777 6 MILE FINAL, REPORT IN SIGHT."

    **Pilot**: “TRAFFIC IN SIGHT, A6-CYI."

    **Controller**: "A6-CYI, NUMBER TWO BEHIND THAT TRAFFIC, REPORT FINAL RUNWAY 30L, CAUTION WAKE TURBULENCE."

    **Pilot**: “NUMBER TWO REPORT FINAL RUNWAY 30L, CAUTION COPIED, A6-CYI."

### 3.3.9 Coordinating circuit traffic
!!! example
    **Controller**: "A6-CYI, EXTEND DOWNWIND, NUMBER TWO FOLLOWING CESSNA 172 ON FOUR MILES FINAL."

    **Pilot**: “EXTENDING DOWNWIND, NUMBER TWO TRAFFIC IN SIGHT, A6-CYI."

    **Controller**: "A6-CYI, TRAFFIC IS A BOEING 777 6 MILE FINAL, REPORT IN SIGHT."

    **Pilot**: “TRAFFIC IN SIGHT, A6-CYI."

    **Controller**: "A6-CYI, NUMBER TWO BEHIND THAT TRAFFIC, REPORT FINAL RUNWAY 30L, CAUTION WAKE TURBULENCE."

    **Pilot**: “NUMBER TWO REPORT FINAL RUNWAY 30L, CAUTION COPIED, A6-CYI."

### 3.3.10 Final approach and landing
#### 3.3.10.1 General
!!! example
    **Pilot**: “DUBAI TOWER, EMIRATES 381, 7 MILES FINAL, RUNWAY 30L."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 381, CONTINUE APPROACH RUNWAY 30L, NUMBER ONE."

    **Pilot**: “RUNWAY 30L, CONTINUE APPROACH NUMBER ONE, EMIRATES 381."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 381, WIND 270 DEGREES 13 KNOTS, RUNWAY 30L CLEARED TO LAND."

    **Pilot**: “CLEARED TO LAND, RUNWAY 30L, EMIRATES 381."

**Note**: *The pilot should not readback the surface winds, nor should the controller expect a readback of this.*

#### 3.3.10.2 RRSM specific
!!! example
    **Pilot**: “DUBAI TOWER, EMIRATES 381, 7 MILES FINAL, RUNWAY 30L."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 381, PLAN TO VACATE K8, CONTINUE APPROACH RUNWAY 30L, NUMBER ONE."

    **Pilot**: “VACATE K8 RUNWAY 30L, CONTINUE APPROACH NUMBER ONE, EMIRATES 381."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 381, WIND 270 DEGREES 13 KNOTS, RUNWAY 30L CLEARED TO LAND."

    **Pilot**: “CLEARED TO LAND, RUNWAY 30L, EMIRATES 381."

**Note**: *The pilot should not readback the surface winds, nor should the controller expect a readback of this.*

If RRSM procedures are being utilised, traffic information should be incorporated into the landing clearance.

### 3.3.11 Touch and go
If an aircraft wishes to perform a touch and go, the vacate point should be omitted from the clearance and “CLEARED TO LAND” should be replaced with “CLEARED TOUCH AND GO”

!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 381, WIND 270 DEGREES 13 KNOTS, RUNWAY 30L, CLEARED TOUCH AND GO."

    **Pilot**: “CLEARED TOUCH AND GO RUNWAY 30L, EMIRATES 381."

### 3.3.12 Cancelling landing clearance
Where ATC wishes to cancel a landing clearance in situations where it will be re-issued in good time for the aircraft to make a safe landing, in order to avoid the pilot initiating a missed approach before the transmission is complete, the following phraseology applies:

!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 381, CONTINUE APPROACH CANCEL LANDING CLEARANCE [REASON] ACKNOWLEDGE."

    **Pilot**: “LANDING CLEARANCE CANCELLED, CONTINUING APPROACH, EMIRATES 381."

When time permits, a reason for cancelling the landing clearance should be given.

### 3.3.13 Wind shear
On receipt of an air-report of wind shear or other weather hazards, the controller should: 

- Immediately relay the report to other aircraft concerned by hazardous weather phenomena 
- Pass the full report to the associated MET unit 
- Pass the information to other ATSUs that may be affected by hazardous weather phenomena. 

**Note**: *A warning may be broadcast on the ATIS (where possible).*

Wind shear reports should be relayed using the following standard sequence, the contents depending upon the details of the original report: 

- Wind shear — identifier 
- Aircraft type — added if not included in the original report 
- Description of event — no change to the report as received from the pilot. See also below
- Height wind shear encountered — no change to the report as received from the pilot
- Phase of flight — no change to the report as received from the pilot
- Runway — added if not included in the original report
- Time of encounter — no change to the report as received from the pilot 
- MET/operational information (speed loss or speed gain) — no change to the report as received from the pilot.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 381, CAUTION WIND SHEAR. AT 0937 BOEING 747 REPORTED STRONG WIND AT 300 FT ON APPROACH RWY 27. MAX THRUST WAS REQUIRED."

    **Pilot**: “ROGER, EMIRATES 381."

ATSU should continue to transmit information on wind shear conditions until it is confirmed, either by subsequent aircraft reports or by advice from the associated MET unit, that conditions are no longer a hazard to ensure safe operations at the aerodrome.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 381, CAUTION WIND SHEAR. AT 0745 AIRBUS 320 REPORTED AFTER DEPARTURE RUNWAY 30R AT 800 FEET AIRSPEED LOSS OF 20 KNOTS, STRONG RIGHT DRIFT."

    **Pilot**: “ROGER, EMIRATES 381."

### 3.3.14 Wake turbulence
When wake turbulence is suspected or known to exist ATC will warn aircraft as appropriate.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "A6-CYI, CAUTION WAKE TURBULENCE FROM ARRIVING/DEPARTING (type of aircraft) [additional information as required]."

    **Pilot**: “ROGER, A6-CYI."

### 3.3.15 Go around
If the runway is not available for landing, or to ensure ATC separation, or to avert an unsafe situation, this instruction will be given. Any transmissions to aircraft should be brief and kept to a minimum.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 642, GO AROUND I SAY AGAIN GO AROUND ACKNOWLEDGE."

    **Pilot**: “GOING AROUND, EMIRATES 642."

Only if time permits a reason for the go around instruction should be included.

In the event that this procedure is initiated by the pilot, the phrase “GOING AROUND” will be used. Unless instructed otherwise, an IFR aircraft will carry out the missed approach procedure and a VFR aircraft will continue in the normal traffic circuit.

### 3.3.16 After landing
Pilot of an aircraft should remain on the tower frequency until clear of the runway-in-use, then, the tower controller should instruct that aircraft to contact ground movement control on the appropriate frequency for taxi instructions.

The tower controller should ensure the arriving aircraft is clear of the rapid exit taxiway before handing the aircraft over to ground movement control. In this situation the tower controller can give an initial taxi instruction to ensure an expeditious flow of traffic and to keep the rapid exit taxiway clear for the next arriving aircraft.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 642, TAXI RIGHT ON K, HOLD KM."

    **Pilot**: “RIGHT ONTO K, HOLD KM, EMIRATES 642."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 642, CONTACT GROUND ON 118.350."

    **Pilot**: “CONTACT GROUND 118.350, EMIRATES 642."

If the arriving aircraft is taking too long to vacate which could impact the safety of the next arriving aircraft, controllers shall request that aircraft to “expedite vacate”

!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 642, EXPEDITE VACATE."

    **Pilot**: “EXPEDITE VACATE, EMIRATES 642."

### 3.3.17 Runway crossings
Sometimes it is necessary to cross aircraft across a runway the instruction should be clear and instructions for after the crossing should also be included.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 642, AT K11, CROSS RUNWAY 30L, HOLD SHORT RUNWAY 30R."

    **Pilot**: “AT K11, CROSS RUNWAY 30L, HOLD SHORT RUNWAY 30R, EMIRATES 642."

## 3.4 Approach and departure control
### 3.4.1 Radar identification
Vectors may be given to establish the identification of an aircraft. Other means of ATS surveillance service identification are the use of position report information, requesting the aircraft to make turns, the use of bearing and distance information from a prominent object or radio aid, transfer of control and the use of SSR.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "OMAN AIR 642, FOR IDENTIFICATION TURN LEFT 080."

    **Pilot**: “FOR IDENTIFICATION TURN LEFT 080, OMAN AIR 642."

The pilot should be warned if identification is lost, or about to be lost, and appropriate instructions given.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "OMAN AIR 642, IDENTIFICATION LOST DUE RADAR FAILURE, CONTACT U.A.E RADAR 124.85."

    **Pilot**: “ROGER, CONTACT U.A.E RADAR 124.85, OMAN AIR 642"

    **Controller**: "OMAN AIR 642, WILL SHORTLY LOSE IDENTIFICATION TEMPORARILY, DUE FADE AREA, REMAIN THIS FREQUENCY."

    **Pilot**: “WILCO,  OMAN AIR 642"

### 3.4.2 Radar vectoring
Radar vectors can be used to ensure lateral separation as well as being used to position an aircraft for its final approach course. Aircraft should be informed of the reason for the vectors unless it is self-evident.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 4CK, TURN LEFT HEADING 050 FOR TRAFFIC."

    **Pilot**: "TURN LEFT HEADING 050, EMIRATES 4CK."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 4CK, TURN RIGHT HEADING 210, BASE LEG."

    **Pilot**: "TURN LEFT HEADING 210, BASE LEG, EMIRATES 4CK."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 4CK, MAINTAIN PRESENT HEADING."

    **Pilot**: "PRESENT HEADING, EMIRATES 4CK."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 4CK, TURN LEFT BY 10 DEGREES, REPORT NEW HEADING."

    **Pilot**: "LEFT BY 10 DEGREES, NEW HEADING 350 DEGREES, EMIRATES 4CK."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 4CK, REPORT YOUR HEADING."

    **Pilot**: "HEADING 050 DEGREES, EMIRATES 4CK."

When vectoring is completed, pilots will be instructed to resume their own navigation and given position information and appropriate instructions as necessary.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 4CK, RESUME OWN NAVIGATION, DIRECT SENPA."

    **Pilot**: "RESUME OWN NAVIGATION, DIRECT SENPA, EMIRATES 4CK."

Occasionally aircraft may be instructed to make a complete turn through 360 degrees for delaying purposes or to achieve a required spacing behind preceding traffic.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 4CK, ORBIT LEFT FOR SPACING."

    **Pilot**: "ORBIT LEFT FOR SPACING, EMIRATES 4CK."

### 3.4.3 Traffic information and avoiding action
Information regarding traffic on a conflicting path should be given in the following form: 

- Relative bearing of the conflicting traffic in terms of the 12-hour clock 
- Distance from the conflicting traffic 
- Direction of the flight of the conflicting traffic 
- Any other pertinent information such as: unknown, slow moving, fast moving, closing, opposite (or same) direction, overtaking, crossing left to right (or right to left), and if known, aircraft type and level, climbing or descending. 

Avoiding action to be taken by the pilot is given when the controller considers that an imminent risk of collision will exist if action is not taken immediately.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 9901, UNKNOWN TRAFFIC 10 O'CLOCK, 11 MILES, FAST MOVING CROSSING RIGHT TO LEFT."

    **Pilot**: "NEGATIVE CONTACT, REQUEST VECTORS, EMIRATES 9901."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 9901, TURN LEFT HEAIDNG 050 DEGREES."

    **Pilot**: "TURN LEFT HEADING 050, EMIRATES 9901."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 9901, CLEAR OF TRAFFIC, RESUME OWN NAVIGATION, DIRECT TO IVURO."

    **Pilot**: "RESUME OWN NAVIGATION, DIRECT TO IVURO, EMIRATES 9901."

### 3.4.4 Tradar vectors to final approach
Radar vectors are given to arriving flights to position them onto a pilot-interpreted final approach aid, or to a point from which a visual approach can be made. In the following example an identified aircraft is given radar vectors to the ILS.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "DUBAI ARRIVALS, EMIRATES 202, VUTEB3D ARRIVAL, PASSING FL150, DESCENDING TO 10,000 FEET, INFORMATION CHARLIE, QNH 1014."
    
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 202, DUBAI ARRIVALS, IDENTIFIED, DESCEND TO ALTITUDE 8,000 FEET, EXPECT VECTORING FOR ILS APPROACH RUNWAY 30L, NO DELAY."

    **Pilot**: "DESCEND TO 8,000 FEET, RUNWAY 30L, EMIRATES 202."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 202, LEAVE PATID HEADING 210."

    **Pilot**: "LEAVING PATID HEADING 210, EMIRATES 202."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 202, REDUCE SPEED TO 210 KNOTS (MINIMUM CLEAN SPEED, NO ATC SPEED RESTRICTIONS, ETC...)."

    **Pilot**: "REDUCE SPEED 210 KNOTS, EMIRATES 202 (OR APPROPRIATE RESPONSE)."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 202, DESCEND TO ALTITUDE 4,000 FEET, NUMBER FOUR IN TRAFFIC."

    **Pilot**: "LEAVING 7,000 FEET DESCENDING TO 4,000 FEET, EMIRATES 202."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 202, 25 TRACK MILES FROM TOUCH DOWN."

    **Pilot**: "EMIRATES 202."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 202, TURN RIGHT HEADING 210 DEGREES, BASE LEG, REDUCE SPEED TO 180 KNOTS."

    **Pilot**: "HEADING 210 DEGREES, REDUCING SPEED TO 180, EMIRATES 202."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 202, TURN RIGHT HEADING 270 DEGREES, CLEARED FOR ILS APPROACH, RUNWAY 30L, REPORT ESTABLISHED."

    **Pilot**: "HEADING 270 DEGREES, CLEARED ILS RUNWAY 30L, WILCO, EMIRATES 202."

    **Pilot**: "ESTABLISHED ILS RUNWAY 30L, EMIRATES 202."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 202, CONTACT TOWER 119.550."

    **Pilot**: "TOWER 119.550, EMIRATES 202."

The radar controller should advise the aircraft of its position at least once prior to turning onto final approach.

Pilots will be advised when a controller intends to vector an aircraft through the final approach track and of the reason for the track extension.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "QATARI 6H, CONTINUE PRESENT HEADING, TAKING YOU THROUGH THE LOCALIZER FOR SPACING."

    **Pilot**: "CONTINUE PRESENT HEADING, ROGER, QATARI 6H."

### 3.4.5 IFR departures
Most airports both arrivals and departures are handled by a single control unit. At busier airports, departures and arrivals are handled by specific departure and arrival controllers.

In addition to the ATC route clearance, further instructions for separation purposes may be issued prior to or after take-off.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "ABU DHABI RADAR, KLM 426."
    
    **Controller**: "KLM 426, ABU DHABI RADAR, TURN RIGHT HEADING 040 UNTIL PASSING ALTITUDE 7,000 FEET, THEN DIRECT KANIP."

    **Pilot**: "TURN RIGHT HEADING 040 UNTIL PASSING ALTITUDE 7,000 FEET, THEN DIRECT KANIP, KLM426."

    **Controller**: "KLM 426, REPORT PASSING ALTITUDE 7,000 FEET."

    **Pilot**: "REPORT PASING ALTITUDE 7,000 FEET, KLM426"

    **Controller**: "KLM 426, CONTACT U.A.E RADAR 124.850."

    **Pilot**: "CONTACT U.A.E RADAR 124.850, KLM426."

### 3.4.6 IFR arrivals
Approach control should advise, on initial contact, the type of approach to be expected (ILS, RNAV, Visual)

!!! example
    **Controller**: "ETIHAD 19D, EXPECT ILS APPROACH RUNWAY 31R AT ABU DHABI."

    **Pilot**: "EXPECT ILS APPROACH RUNWAY 31R, ETIHAD 19D."

On occasions IFR aircraft do not complete the ILS approach procedure but request permission to make a visual approach. When the specific requirements for a visual approach have been met the pilot may make the request using the phrase “REQUEST VISUAL APPROACH”. Controllers will grant the request when traffic permits. 

When cleared by ATC for a visual approach further descent is unrestricted except when a specific restriction is included with the clearance for a visual approach or a specific restriction is included in a subsequent clearance.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "ETIHAD 19D, CLEARED VISUAL APPROACH, RUNWAY 31R."

    **Pilot**: "CLEARED VISUAL APPROACH, RUNWAY 31R, ETIHAD 19D."

### 3.4.7 Clearance via the SID
Clearances to aircraft on a SID with remaining published level and/or speed restrictions shall indicate if such restrictions are to be followed or are cancelled. The following phraseologies shall be used with the following meanings: 

`CLIMB VIA SID TO <Cleared level>`:

- Climb to the cleared level and comply with published level restrictions 
- Follow the lateral profile of the SID 
- Comply with published speed restrictions or ATC-issued speed control instructions as applicable. 

`CLIMB VIA SID TO <Cleared level>, CANCEL LEVEL RESTRICTION(S)`: 

- Climb to the cleared level, published level restrictions are cancelled

- Follow the lateral profile of the SID 
- Published speed restrictions and ATC-issued speed control instructions are cancelled. 

If there are no remaining published level or speed restrictions on the SID, the phrase `CLIMB TO <Cleared level>` should be used. 

When subsequent speed restriction instructions are issued, and if the cleared level is unchanged, the phrase `CLIMB VIA SID TO <Cleared level>` should be omitted. 

When a departing aircraft is cleared to proceed direct to a published waypoint on the SID, the speed and level restrictions associated with the bypassed waypoints are cancelled. All remaining published speed and level restrictions shall remain applicable. 

When a departing aircraft is vectored or cleared to proceed to a point that is not on the SID, all the published speed and level restrictions of the SID are cancelled, and the controller shall: 

- Reiterate the cleared level 
- Provide speed and level restrictions as necessary 
- Notify the pilot if it is expected that the aircraft will be instructed to subsequently re-join the SID. 

ATC instructions to an aircraft to re-join a SID shall include: 

- The designator of the SID to be re-joined unless advance notification of re-join has been provided in accordance with above 
- The cleared level on re-joining the SID in accordance with above 
- The position at which it is expected to re-join the SID.

Then 

- `REJOIN SID [<SID designator>] [AT <waypoint>]`

- `CLEARED DIRECT <waypoint>, CLIMB TO <Cleared level>`

Then 

- `REJOIN SID <SID designator> AT <waypoint>`

### 3.4.7 Clearances via the STAR

Published speed restrictions and ATC-issued speed control instructions are cancelled. 

If there are no remaining published level or speed restrictions on the STAR, the phrase `DESCEND TO <Cleared level>` should be used. 

When subsequent speed restriction instructions are issued and if the cleared level is unchanged, the phrase `DESCEND VIA STAR TO <Cleared level>` should be omitted. 

When an arriving aircraft is cleared to proceed direct to a published waypoint on the STAR, the speed and level restrictions associated with the bypassed waypoints are cancelled. All remaining published speed and level restrictions shall remain applicable. 

When an arriving aircraft is vectored or cleared to proceed to a point that is not on the STAR, all the published speed and level restrictions of the STAR are cancelled, and the controller shall: 

- Reiterate the cleared level 
- Provide speed and level restrictions as necessary 
- Notify the pilot if it is expected that the aircraft will be instructed to subsequently re-join the STAR. 

ATC instructions to an aircraft to re-join a STAR shall include: 

- The designator of the STAR to be re-joined, unless advance notification of re-join has been provided in accordance with above 
- The cleared level on re-joining the STAR in accordance with above 
- The position at which it is expected to re-join the STAR. 

Phraseology on re-join instructions:

Then 

- `REJOIN STAR [<STAR designator>] [AT <waypoint>]`
- `CLEARED DIRECT <waypoint>, DESCEND TO <Cleared level>`

Then 

- `REJOIN STAR <STAR designator> AT <waypoint>`

## 3.5 Area Control
Much of the phraseology used in area control is of a general nature and similar to that of approach and departure. However, many instructions used in area control (particularly where radar is not available) are related to specific conditions in order to maintain aircraft separation.

### 3.5.1 Descent clearance
To assist with establishing altitude restrictions, pilots may be assigned `AT OR ABOVE` or `AT OR BELOW` restrictions.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "AIR INDIA 397, REQUEST DESCENT."
    
    **Controller**: "AIR INDIA 398, MAINTAIN FL360, EXPECT DESCENT AFTER PASOV."

    **Pilot**: "MAINTAIN FL350, AIR INDIA 397."

    **Controller**: "AIR INDIA 397, DESCEND TO FL150, CROSS PASOV FL180 OR ABOVE."

    **Pilot**: "DESCEND TO FL150, CROSS PASOV FL170 OR ABOVE, AIR INDIA 397."

### 3.5.2 Position Information
In order to assist in establishing separation, pilots may be instructed to provide additional position report information as well as routing reports.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 550, REPORT 25 MILES FROM THE DOHA VOR."

    **Pilot**: "WILCO, SAUDIA 550."

    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 550, REPORT DISTANCE FROM THE DOHA VOR."

    **Pilot**: "DISTANCE 37 MILES FROM THE DOHA VOR, SAUDIA 550."

### 3.5.3 Level information
Level information consists of climb and descent clearances or instructions and reports of leaving, reaching, and passing levels as detailed in the level Instructions paragraphs in the general procedures and phraseology section. Unless advice is received to the contrary, the aircraft is expected to vacate the level as soon as practicable. Under exceptional circumstances, if instant descent is required, the word “immediately” is used.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 550, WHEN READY DESCEND TO FL150."

    **Pilot**: "WHEN READY DESCEND TO FL150, SAUDIA 550."

    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 550, DESCEND TO FL200, IMMEDIATELY DUE TRAFFIC."

    **Pilot**: "DESCENDING FL200, SAUDIA 550."

An aircraft may request a clearance to climb or descend maintaining own separation while in VMC (available in class D airspace only). The clearance will include information on essential traffic.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "EGYPTAIR 345, REQUEST MAINTAIN OWN SEPARATION IN VMC, DESCENT TO 6,000 FEET."

    **Controller**: "EGYPTAIR 345, DESCEND TO ALTITUDE 6,000 FEET, MAINTAIN OWN SEPARATION IN VMC FROM 9,000 FEET TO 7,000 FEET... TRAFFIC IS..."

    **Pilot**: "LEAVING ... FOR ALTITUDE 6,000 FEET, MAINTAIN OWN SEPARATION IN VMC 9,000 FEET TO 7,000 FEET, TRAFFIC AT <ALTITUDE>, EGYPTAIR 345."

### 3.5.4 Flights entering controlled airspace
IFR or VFR aircraft requiring to enter controlled airspace should make their request to the appropriate ATS unit in sufficient time to allow ATC to assess the traffic situation and issue a clearance prior to the aircraft reaching controlled airspace.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "U.A.E RADAR, PQR."

    **Controller**: "PQR, U.A.E RADAR, PASS YOUR MESSAGE."

    **Pilot**: "PQR, ESTIMATING DARAX 45, ALTITUDE 9,000 FEET, REQUEST CLEARANCE."

    **Controller**: "PQR, CLEARED TO ABU DHABI, VIA M318, ALTITUDE 9,000 FEET, ENTER CONTROL AREA AT DARAX, SQUAWK 5472, QNH 1014."

    **Pilot**: "CLEARED TO ABU DHABI, VIA M318, ALTITUDE 9,000 FEET, ENTER CONTROL AREA AT DARAX, SQUAWK 5472, QNH 1014, PQR."

    **Controller**: "PQR, READBACK CORRECT."

It may be that because of the prevailing traffic situation a clearance cannot be issued immediately. A transponder (squawk) code may be issued to assist ATC in assessing the traffic situation. This does not constitute a clearance to enter controlled airspace.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "PQR, REMAIN OUTSIDE CONTROLLED AIRSPACE, EXPECT CLEARANCE AT TIME 55."

    **Pilot**: "REMAINING OUTSIDE CONTROLLED AIRSPACE, PQR."

### 3.5.5 Flights leaving controlled airspace
Flights leaving controlled airspace will normally be given a track or specific point by which to leave, together with any other relevant instructions necessary to ensure separation.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "A6-CTL, NIBAX 17, 6,000 FEET, ESTIMATE ZAKUM FIELD AT 1253."

    **Controller**: "A6-CTL, LEAVE CONTROLLED AIRSPACE ON TRACK ZAKUM, AT ALTITUDE 6,000 FEET IFR, TRAFFIC IS ... RADAR SERVICE TERMINATED."

    **Pilot**: "LEAVE CONTROLLED AIRSPACE ON TRACK ZAKUM, AT 6,000 FEET, COPY THE TRAFFIC, A6-CTL."

    **Controller**: "A6-CTL, LEAVE CONTROLLED AIRSPACE IN DESCENT, REPORT PASSING ALTITUDE 4,500 FEET, QNH 1014, NO REPORTED TRAFFIC, RADAR SERVICE TERMINATED."

    **Pilot**: "LEAVING CONTROLLED AIRSPACE IN DESCENT, WILL REPORT ALTITUDE 4,500 FEET, QNH 1014, NO REPORTED TRAFFIC, A6-CTL."

### 3.5.6 Holding en-route
When an aircraft is required to hold en-route, the controller should issue holding instructions and a time at which onward clearance can be expected. Where it is not self-evident, the reason for the delay should also be given. Within the Arabian FIRs, a time for an onward clearance is only given if the delay is in excess of 20 minutes.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 4CK, HOLD AT IMPED, FL220, EXPECT FURTHER CLEARANCE, AT TIME 02, LANDING DELAYS AT DUBAI 20 MINUTES."

    **Pilot**: "HOLD AT IMPED, FL220, EMIRATES 4CK."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 4CK, HOLD AT VUTEB, FL160."

    **Pilot**: "HOLD AT VUTEB, FL160, EMIRATES 4CK."
