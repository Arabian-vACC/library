# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 Radiotelephony policy
### 1.1.1 General provisions
Radiotelephony standards are developed to provide efficient, clear, concise, and unambiguous communications between pilots and ATS personnel operating within the Arabian FIRs. Care should be taken the current use of ICAO phraseology in all instances.

All communications shall be delivered in a clear, concise, and unambiguous manner.

### 1.1.2 Standard phraseology
Standardised phraseology shall be used in all situations wherever applicable. However, plain language may be used when standardised phraseology is unable to serve the intended purpose, or to avoid confusion or misunderstanding.

The use of excessive courtesies should be avoided.

The word “IMMEDIATELY” should only be used when immediate action is required for safety reasons.

The expression “TAKE-OFF” shall only be used in radiotelephony when an aircraft is cleared for take-off or when cancelling a take-off clearance.

The expression “TORA”, pronounced TOR-AH, may be used to indicate Take-Off Run Available.

### 1.1.3 Appropriate transmitting technique
The use of correct transmitting technique as laid down in 1.2 ensures that transmissions are clearly and satisfactorily received. Speech transmitting technique should be adapted to the prevailing communications conditions. 

For example, where it is clear that a pilot is unable to understand the contents of a transmission, the rate of speech should be slowed down appropriately.

### 1.1.4 Blocked frequency
An irritating situation in radio telephony is a “stuck” microphone button. ATC and pilots should always ensure that the button is released after a transmission and the microphone placed in an appropriate place ensuring that it will not inadvertently be switched on.

ATC should instruct flight crews to retransmit their message, clearance, or instruction whenever a transmission has been, or suspected to have been, blocked by two or more aircraft, or a transmission was incomplete or garbled.

When it is suspected that a message has been blocked by another transmission ATC shall advise the aircraft with the word “BLOCKED”. In addition, should there be an aircraft transmitting with a stuck mic, they shall be informed immediately.

### 1.1.5 Retransmission of messages
ATC should instruct flight crews to retransmit their message, clearance or instruction whenever a transmission has been, or suspected to have been, blocked by two or more aircraft, or a transmission was incomplete or garbled.

### 1.1.6 Common aviation abbreviations
Some abbreviations have become part of aviation terminology, may be spoken using their constituent letters rather than the phonetic alphabet, for example, ILS, QNH and RVR.

The following words may be omitted from transmissions provided that no confusion or ambiguity will result:

- “SURFACE” in relation to surface wind direction and speed
- “DEGREES” in relation to radar headings
- “VISIBILITY”, “CLOUD”, and “HEIGHT” in meteorological reports
- “HECTOPASCALS” when giving pressure settings, except when the setting is less than 1000, e.g. QNH 998 hectopascals.
- 
## 1.2 Transmitting technique
The following transmitting techniques will assist in ensuring that transmitted speech is clearly and satisfactorily received:

- Before transmitting listen out on the frequency to be used to ensure that there will be no interference with a transmission from another station.
- Be familiar with good microphone operating techniques.
- Use a normal conversation tone, speak clearly and distinctly.
- Maintain an even rate of speech not exceeding 100 words per minute. When it is known that elements of the message will be written down by the recipient, speak at a slightly slower rate.
- Maintain the speaking volume at a constant level.
- A slight pause before and after numbers will assist in making them easier to understand.
- Avoid using hesitation sounds such as “er”.
- Be familiar with microphone operating techniques, particularly in relation to the maintenance of a constant distance from the microphone if a modulator with a constant level is not used.
- Suspend speech temporarily if it becomes necessary to turn the head away from the microphone.
- Depress the transmit switch fully before speaking and do not release it until the message is completed, this will ensure that the entire message is transmitted.
- The transmission of long messages should be interrupted momentarily from time to time to permit the transmitting operator to confirm that the frequency in use is clear, and if necessary, to permit the receiving operator to request repetition of parts not received.
- Exercise caution when language difficulties exist, particularly when dealing with pilots whose first language is seemingly not English.
