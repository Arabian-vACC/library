# 2. General Procedures and Phraseology
## 2.1 Establishment and continuation of communications
### 2.1.1 Initial Contact
During initial contact, aircraft should identify themselves with the full callsign as well as the callsign of the station being addressed.

The responsibility of establishing communication rests with the station with a message to transmit.

When responding to a transmission the phrase “GO AHEAD” shall not be used. The use of the calling station’s callsign and the receiving station’s callsign is considered an invitation to proceed with the message. In addition, the phrase “PASS YOUR MESSAGE” may also be used.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "DUBAI TOWER, EMIRATES 201"

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 201, DUBAI TOWER" OR "EMIRATES 201, DUBAI TOWER, PASS YOUR MESSAGE."

### 2.1.2 Radio test procedures
Aircraft may wish to test the functionality of their VHF equipment and should be done using the following form:

- Identification of the station being called
- The aircraft callsign
- The words “radio check”
- The frequency being used

Replies to test transmissions should be as follows:

- Identification of the aircraft calling
- Identification of the station replying
- Information regarding the readability of the transmission

The readability of the transmission should be in accordance with the following readability scale:

1.	Unreadable
2.	Readable now and then
3.	Readable but with difficulty
4.	Readable
5.	Perfectly readable

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "DUBAI DELIVERY, EMIRATES 587, REQUEST RADIO CHECK ON 120.350."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 587, DUBAI DELIVERY, READABILITY 5."

### 2.1.3 Requesting a repetition
If there is doubt that a message has been correctly received, a repetition should be requested in full or in part.

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| "SAY AGAIN"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Repeat entire message  |
| "SAY AGAIN <Item>"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Repeat specific item   |
| "SAY AGAIN ALL BEFORE `First word satisfactorily received`" **OR** "SAY AGAIN ALL AFTER `Last word satisfactorily received`" **OR** "SAY AGAIN ALL BETWEEN `First word satisfactorily received` AND `Last word satisfactorily received`"                 | Repeat part of message |

When ATC is unsure of the identity of the last station received, the calling station should be requested to repeat its callsign.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "HAMAD TOWER, IFLY 1307."

    **Controller**: "STATION CALLING HAMAD TOWER, SAY AGAIN CALLSIGN."

    **Pilot**: "HAMAD TOWER, IFLY 1307."

### 2.1.4 Correcting a transmission
When an error is made in a transmission, the word “CORRECTION” is used followed by the corrected version of the last phrase that was repeated.

If it is more appropriate to make a correction by repeating the entire message, the phrase “CORRECTION, I SAY AGAIN” is used before transmitting the entire message a second time.

## 2.2 Transmission of letters
Except where aircraft have designated callsigns, or the type of aircraft is being indicated, each letter in the aircraft callsign shall be spoken separately using the phonetic spelling.

|    Thousand    |      TOU-SAND     |

All numbers must be transmitted by pronouncing each digit separately in the following cases:

- Aircraft callsigns
- Flight levels
- Headings
- Wind direction and speed
- Transponder codes
- Runway/taxiway designators
- Altimeter settings
- Times
- Frequencies

All numbers used in the transmission of aircraft call-signs, flight levels, headings, wind direction and speed, transponder codes, runway/taxiway designators, altimeter settings, time, and frequencies must be transmitted by pronouncing each digit separately: 

- Taxiway designators - First option:  Standard Phraseology: “MIKE ONE THREE ALPHA” 
- Taxiway designators - Second option: Standard Phraseology combined with Repeated Standard Phraseology: “MIKE ONE THREE ALPHA, I SAY AGAIN, MIKE ONE THREE ALPHA”
- Taxiway designators - Third option:  Standard Phraseology combined with Plain Language: “MIKE ONE THREE ALPHA, I SAY AGAIN, MIKE THIRTEEN ALPHA”

## 2.5 Transmission of time
When transmitting time, only the minutes of the hour are normally required. Each digit should be pronounced separately, however the hour should be included when any possibility of confusion is likely to result. 

Co-ordinated universal time (UTC/” Zulu”) shall be used. 

Pilots may check the time with the appropriate ATS unit. Time checks must be given to the nearest half minute.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "QATARI 1018, REQUEST TIME CHECK."

    **Controller**: "QATARI 1018, TIME 0611" OR "QATARI 1018, TIME 0716 AND A HALF"

## 2.6 Standard words and phrases
The following words and phrases must be used in radiotelephony communications as appropriate and when used have the meaning given below 

The phrase “GO AHEAD” should be avoided, in its place the use of the calling aeronautical stations call sign followed by the answering aeronautical stations call sign shall be considered the invitation to proceed with transmission by the station calling.

### 2.7.1 Aircraft callsigns
!!! info
    Source material for this section has been taken from the U.A.E GCAA CAAP 47 document.

An aircraft shall not change its call sign during flight except when there is a likelihood that confusion may occur because of similar call signs, and the aircraft has been instructed by an air traffic control unit to change its call sign temporarily: 

- First option – Standard Phraseology: “AIRLINE ONE TWO THREE”
- Second option – Standard Phraseology combined with Repeated Standard Phraseology: “AIRLINE ONE TWO THREE, I SAY AGAIN, AIRLINE ONE TWO THREE” 
- Third option– Standard Phraseology combined with Plain Language: “AIRLINE ONE TWO THREE, I SAY AGAIN, AIRLINE ONE TWENTY-THREE" 

Aircraft in the heavy wake turbulence category shall include the word “HEAVY/ SUPER” as applicable immediately after the aircraft call sign in the initial contact between such aircraft and ATS units.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "PAKISTAN TWO ONE EIGHT, CHANGE CALLSIGN TO PAKISTAN TWO ONE LIMA [UNTIL FURTHER ADVISED]."

    **Pilot**: "PAKISTAN TWO ONE EIGHT, CHANGE TO PAKISTAN TWO ONE LIMA."

    **Controller**: "PAKISTAN TWO ONE LIMA REVERT TO FLIGHT PLAN CALLSIGN [AT TIME/REP]."

    **Pilot**: "PAKISTAN TWO ONE LIMA WILCO."

## 2.8 Transfer of communications
An aircraft shall be advised by the appropriate aeronautical station to change from one radio frequency to another in accordance with letter of agreements between ATS units.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "SKYDUBAI 12, CONTACT U.A.E RADAR ON 132.150."

    **Pilot**: "CONTACT U.A.E RADAR 132.150, SKYDUBAI 12"

    **Controller**: "SKYDUBAI 12, WHEN PASSING ALTITUDE 10,000 FEET, CONTACT U.A.E RADAR ON 132.150."

    **Pilot**: "WHEN PASSING ALTITUDE 10,000 FEET, CONTACT U.A.E RADAR ON 132.150, SKYDUBAI 12."
