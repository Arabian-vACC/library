# 2. General Procedures and Phraseology
## 2.1 Establishment and continuation of communications
### 2.1.1 Initial Contact
During initial contact, aircraft should identify themselves with the full callsign as well as the callsign of the station being addressed.

The responsibility of establishing communication rests with the station with a message to transmit.

When responding to a transmission the phrase “GO AHEAD” shall not be used. The use of the calling station’s callsign and the receiving station’s callsign is considered an invitation to proceed with the message. In addition, the phrase “PASS YOUR MESSAGE” may also be used.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "DUBAI TOWER, EMIRATES 201"

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 201, DUBAI TOWER" OR "EMIRATES 201, DUBAI TOWER, PASS YOUR MESSAGE."

### 2.1.2 Radio test procedures
Aircraft may wish to test the functionality of their VHF equipment and should be done using the following form:

- Identification of the station being called
- The aircraft callsign
- The words “radio check”
- The frequency being used

Replies to test transmissions should be as follows:

- Identification of the aircraft calling
- Identification of the station replying
- Information regarding the readability of the transmission

The readability of the transmission should be in accordance with the following readability scale:

1.	Unreadable
2.	Readable now and then
3.	Readable but with difficulty
4.	Readable
5.	Perfectly readable

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "DUBAI DELIVERY, EMIRATES 587, REQUEST RADIO CHECK ON 120.350."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 587, DUBAI DELIVERY, READABILITY 5."

### 2.1.3 Requesting a repetition
If there is doubt that a message has been correctly received, a repetition should be requested in full or in part.

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| "SAY AGAIN"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Repeat entire message  |
| "SAY AGAIN <Item>"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Repeat specific item   |
| "SAY AGAIN ALL BEFORE `First word satisfactorily received`"<br>**OR**<br>"SAY AGAIN ALL AFTER `Last word satisfactorily received`"<br>**OR**<br>"SAY AGAIN ALL BETWEEN `First word satisfactorily received` AND `Last word satisfactorily received`" | Repeat part of message |

When ATC is unsure of the identity of the last station received, the calling station should be requested to repeat its callsign.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "HAMAD TOWER, IFLY 1307."

    **Controller**: "STATION CALLING HAMAD TOWER, SAY AGAIN CALLSIGN."

    **Pilot**: "HAMAD TOWER, IFLY 1307."

### 2.1.4 Correcting a transmission
When an error is made in a transmission, the word “CORRECTION” is used followed by the corrected version of the last phrase that was repeated.

If it is more appropriate to make a correction by repeating the entire message, the phrase “CORRECTION, I SAY AGAIN” is used before transmitting the entire message a second time.

## 2.2 Transmission of letters
Except where aircraft have designated callsigns, or the type of aircraft is being indicated, each letter in the aircraft callsign shall be spoken separately using the phonetic spelling.
