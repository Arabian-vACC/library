# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 Radiotelephony policy
### 1.1.1 General provisions
**Radiotelephony standards are established to ensure efficient, clear, concise, and unambiguous communication between pilots and ATS personnel within the Arabian FIRs. All communications must adhere to ICAO phraseology to maintain consistency and clarity.**

All communications should be delivered in a clear, concise, and unambiguous manner to prevent misunderstandings and ensure safety.

### 1.1.2 Standard phraseology
**Standardised phraseology must be used in all situations where applicable.** However, plain language may be used if standardised phraseology cannot serve the intended purpose, or to prevent confusion or misunderstanding.

- The use of excessive courtesies should be avoided.
- The word **“IMMEDIATELY”** should only be used when immediate action is required for safety reasons.
- The expression **“TAKE-OFF”** shall only be used in radiotelephony when an aircraft is cleared for take-off or when cancelling a take-off clearance.
- The expression **“TORA”**, pronounced TOR-AH, may be used to indicate **Take-Off Run Available**.

### 1.1.3 Appropriate transmitting technique
The use of correct transmitting technique, as outlined in section 1.2, ensures that transmissions are clearly and satisfactorily received. **Speech transmitting technique should be adapted to the prevailing communication conditions.**

For example, if it becomes clear that a pilot is unable to understand the contents of a transmission, the **rate of speech should be slowed down appropriately**.

### 1.1.4 Blocked frequency
An irritating situation in radio telephony is a **"stuck" microphone button**. **ATC and pilots should always ensure that the button is released after a transmission**, and the microphone should be placed in an appropriate location to ensure it will not inadvertently be switched on.

**ATC should instruct flight crews to retransmit their message, clearance, or instruction** whenever a transmission has been, or is suspected to have been, blocked by two or more aircraft, or if a transmission was incomplete or garbled.

When it is suspected that a message has been blocked by another transmission, **ATC shall advise the aircraft using the word “BLOCKED”**. Additionally, if there is an aircraft transmitting with a stuck mic, **they shall be informed immediately**.

### 1.1.5 Retransmission of messages
**ATC should instruct flight crews to retransmit their message, clearance, or instruction** whenever a transmission has been, or is suspected to have been, blocked by two or more aircraft, or if the transmission was incomplete or garbled.

### 1.1.6 Common aviation abbreviations
**Some abbreviations have become part of aviation terminology** and may be spoken using their constituent letters rather than the phonetic alphabet, for example, ILS, QNH, and RVR.

The following words **may be omitted from transmissions** provided that no confusion or ambiguity will result:

- "SURFACE" in relation to surface wind direction and speed
- "DEGREES" in relation to radar headings
- "VISIBILITY", "CLOUD", and "HEIGHT" in meteorological reports
- "HECTOPASCALS" when giving pressure settings, except when the setting is less than 1000 (e.g., QNH 998 hectopascals).

## 1.2 Transmitting technique
To ensure that transmitted speech is received clearly and effectively, adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Monitor the Frequency**  
   Before transmitting, listen to the frequency to ensure it is clear and will not interfere with transmissions from other stations.

2. **Practice Good Microphone Techniques**  
   Be familiar with effective microphone operation and maintain a constant distance from the microphone unless using a modulator with automatic level adjustment.

3. **Speak Clearly and at an Appropriate Volume**  
   Use a normal conversational tone, speak distinctly, and keep your speaking volume consistent.

4. **Maintain a Controlled Speech Rate**  
   Speak at a steady pace, not exceeding 100 words per minute. If the message will be written down by the recipient, slow down slightly to improve comprehension.

5. **Pause Around Numbers**  
   Include brief pauses before and after numbers to enhance clarity and ensure accurate understanding.

6. **Avoid Hesitation Sounds**  
   Minimize the use of hesitation sounds like “er” to maintain clear communication.

7. **Adapt for Head Movement**  
   Pause speech if you need to turn your head away from the microphone to prevent loss of clarity.

8. **Proper Use of the Transmit Switch**  
   Depress the transmit switch fully before speaking and release it only after completing your message to ensure the entire transmission is captured.

9. **Interruption for Long Messages**  
   For lengthy transmissions, pause periodically to confirm the frequency is clear and allow the receiving operator to request repetitions if necessary.

10. **Language Considerations**  
    Be mindful of potential language barriers, especially when communicating with pilots or operators whose first language may not be English. Adjust your communication style to enhance understanding.

By following these techniques, you will contribute to effective and efficient communication.
