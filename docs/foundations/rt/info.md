## Scope
This document lays down the standard procedures when communicating via radio for ATC and aircraft. It is applicable to all aerodromes and aircraft operating withing Arabian vACC airspace. It is not possible to provide phraseologies to cover every situation which may arise, and the examples contained in this manual are not exhaustive, but merely representative of radio telephony phraseology in common use, however if standard phrases are adhered to any possible ambiguity will be reduced to minimum.

The radiotelephony examples in this manual are generalised to apply to all airports. Where there is a discrepancy between the radiotelephony procedures specified in SOPs and the procedures specified in this manual, the former should take precedent.
