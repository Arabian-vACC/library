# 2. General Procedures and Phraseology
## 2.1 Establishment and continuation of communications
### 2.1.1 Initial Contact
1. **Identification During Initial Contact**  
   Aircraft should identify themselves using their full callsign along with the callsign of the station being addressed.

2. **Responsibility for Establishing Communication**  
   The responsibility for initiating communication lies with the station that has a message to transmit.

3. **Response Protocols**  
   - Avoid using the phrase “GO AHEAD” when responding to a transmission.  
   - Instead, use the callsign of the calling station and the receiving station’s callsign to invite the transmission of the message.  
   - Alternatively, the phrase “PASS YOUR MESSAGE” may also be used as an appropriate response.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "DUBAI TOWER, EMIRATES 201"

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 201, DUBAI TOWER" OR "EMIRATES 201, DUBAI TOWER, PASS YOUR MESSAGE."

### 2.1.2 Radio test procedures
When testing VHF equipment, the following format should be used:

1. Identify the station being called.  
2. Provide the aircraft’s callsign.  
3. Use the phrase “radio check.”  
4. Specify the frequency being used.

Responses to test transmissions should include:

1. Identification of the aircraft making the call.  
2. Identification of the station replying.  
3. Information regarding the readability of the transmission.

The readability of the transmission should be reported using the following standardized scale:

1. **Unreadable**  
2. **Readable now and then**  
3. **Readable but with difficulty**  
4. **Readable**  
5. **Perfectly readable**

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "DUBAI DELIVERY, EMIRATES 587, REQUEST RADIO CHECK ON 120.350."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 587, DUBAI DELIVERY, READABILITY 5."

### 2.1.3 Requesting a repetition
If there is any uncertainty about whether a message has been correctly received, a repetition should be requested either in full or in part.

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| "SAY AGAIN"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Repeat entire message  |
| "SAY AGAIN <Item>"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Repeat specific item   |
| "SAY AGAIN ALL BEFORE `First word satisfactorily received`" **OR** "SAY AGAIN ALL AFTER `Last word satisfactorily received`" **OR** "SAY AGAIN ALL BETWEEN `First word satisfactorily received` AND `Last word satisfactorily received`"                 | Repeat part of message |

When ATC is uncertain of the identity of the last station received, the calling station should be asked to repeat its callsign.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "HAMAD TOWER, IFLY 1307."

    **Controller**: "STATION CALLING HAMAD TOWER, SAY AGAIN CALLSIGN."

    **Pilot**: "HAMAD TOWER, IFLY 1307."

### 2.1.4 Correcting a transmission
1. **Correcting a Specific Phrase**  
   If an error is made during transmission, use the word **“CORRECTION”** followed by the corrected version of the last phrase.

2. **Correcting the Entire Message**  
   When it is more appropriate to correct the error by repeating the entire message, use the phrase **“CORRECTION, I SAY AGAIN”** before retransmitting the full message.

## 2.2 Transmission of letters
Unless the aircraft has a designated callsign or the type of aircraft is being referenced, each letter in the aircraft’s callsign must be spoken individually using phonetic spelling.

|     Hundred    |      HUN-dred     |
|    Thousand    |      TOU-SAND     |

All numbers must be pronounced digit by digit in the following contexts:

- Aircraft callsigns  
- Flight levels  
- Headings  
- Wind direction and speed  
- Transponder codes  
- Runway/taxiway designators  
- Altimeter settings  
- Times  
- Frequencies  

For taxiway designators, the following options are available:

1. **Standard Phraseology**  
   Example: “MIKE ONE THREE ALPHA”  

2. **Standard Phraseology with Repetition**  
   Example: “MIKE ONE THREE ALPHA, I SAY AGAIN, MIKE ONE THREE ALPHA”  

3. **Standard Phraseology with Plain Language**  
   Example: “MIKE ONE THREE ALPHA, I SAY AGAIN, MIKE THIRTEEN ALPHA”

## 2.5 Transmission of time
1. **Minutes and Hours**  
   - When transmitting time, only the minutes of the hour are typically required.  
   - Pronounce each digit separately.  
   - Include the hour if there is a possibility of confusion.

2. **Use of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)**  
   - Time must be transmitted using Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), also referred to as "Zulu" time.

3. **Time Checks**  
   - Pilots may request a time check from the appropriate ATS unit.  
   - Time checks must be accurate to the nearest half-minute.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "QATARI 1018, REQUEST TIME CHECK."

    **Controller**: "QATARI 1018, TIME 0611" OR "QATARI 1018, TIME 0716 AND A HALF"

## 2.6 Standard words and phrases
1. **Use of Standard Words and Phrases**  
   Specific words and phrases must be used in radiotelephony communications as appropriate. When used, they carry the meanings assigned to them.

2. **Avoiding the Phrase “GO AHEAD”**  
   - The phrase “GO AHEAD” should be avoided.  
   - Instead, the calling aeronautical station’s callsign followed by the answering aeronautical station’s callsign should be used as an invitation to proceed with the transmission.

### 2.7.1 Aircraft callsigns
!!! info
    The information in this section is based on the U.A.E GCAA CAAP 47 document.

2. **Changing Aircraft Call Signs**  
   An aircraft shall not change its call sign during flight unless there is a risk of confusion due to similar call signs, and the aircraft has been instructed by an air traffic control unit to temporarily change its call sign.

   - **First option** – Standard Phraseology: “AIRLINE ONE TWO THREE”
   - **Second option** – Standard Phraseology with Repeated Standard Phraseology: “AIRLINE ONE TWO THREE, I SAY AGAIN, AIRLINE ONE TWO THREE”
   - **Third option** – Standard Phraseology with Plain Language: “AIRLINE ONE TWO THREE, I SAY AGAIN, AIRLINE ONE TWENTY-THREE”

3. **Heavy Wake Turbulence Category**  
   Aircraft in the heavy wake turbulence category must include the word **“HEAVY”** or **“SUPER”** (as applicable) immediately after the aircraft’s call sign during the initial contact with ATS units.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "PAKISTAN TWO ONE EIGHT, CHANGE CALLSIGN TO PAKISTAN TWO ONE LIMA [UNTIL FURTHER ADVISED]."

    **Pilot**: "PAKISTAN TWO ONE EIGHT, CHANGE TO PAKISTAN TWO ONE LIMA."

    **Controller**: "PAKISTAN TWO ONE LIMA REVERT TO FLIGHT PLAN CALLSIGN [AT TIME/REP]."

    **Pilot**: "PAKISTAN TWO ONE LIMA WILCO."

## 2.8 Transfer of communications
An aircraft shall be instructed by the appropriate aeronautical station to change from one radio frequency to another, in accordance with the letter of agreements between ATS units.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "SKYDUBAI 12, CONTACT U.A.E RADAR ON 132.150."

    **Pilot**: "CONTACT U.A.E RADAR 132.150, SKYDUBAI 12"

    **Controller**: "SKYDUBAI 12, WHEN PASSING ALTITUDE 10,000 FEET, CONTACT U.A.E RADAR ON 132.150."

    **Pilot**: "WHEN PASSING ALTITUDE 10,000 FEET, CONTACT U.A.E RADAR ON 132.150, SKYDUBAI 12."
