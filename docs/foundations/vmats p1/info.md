## Scope
This document is a generalised manual for the provision of air traffic control services within the Arabian vACC airspace. It contains the techniques, procedures and essential information required to provide effective air traffic control service. Some procedures have been modified slightly from their real-world counterparts so that they are compatible with the expected skill level of pilots on the VATSIM network.

For specific procedures for each aerodrome, terminal area or enroute position, controllers should refer to the respective SOP documents, as certain aerodromes may apply different procedures to those described in this document. 

In addition, this document is adapted for the procedures specific to the Arabian vACC and should not be considered a comprehensive guide to air traffic control. Further information can be obtained from the appropriate ICAO documentation and the respective countries Civil Aviation Rules.
