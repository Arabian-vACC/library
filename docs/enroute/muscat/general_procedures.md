# 2. General Procedures
## 2.1 General Provisions
Area Control is responsible for providing surveillance-based control service and flight information service to traffic operating within the Muscat FIR outside the lateral and vertical limits of CTA/TMAs.

## 2.2 Separation Minima
### 2.2.1 Surveillance-based Separation
Except as otherwise specified, aircraft operating within the Muscat FIR under radar control shall be separated as follows:

- A minimum of **5 NM horizontal radar separation** shall be applied between aircraft.
- If horizontal separation is not feasible, **vertical separation** shall be used:
  - **1,000 ft** up to and including **FL410** in RVSM airspace.
  - **2,000 ft** above FL410 unless both aircraft are RVSM-approved.

Controllers shall utilise appropriate vectoring, speed control, and management of aircraft lateral and vertical profiles to ensure that the applicable separation minima are maintained in accordance with ICAO Doc 4444.

### 2.2.2 Enroute Longitudinal Separation
#### 2.2.2.1 Aircraft in Level Flight
Aircraft operating in the enroute phase of flight on the same airway at the same level shall be separated longitudinally by a minimum of **20 NM**.  

This minimum may be reduced to **10 NM** if the leading aircraft is travelling **20 knots or more** faster than the trailing aircraft. 

#### 2.2.2.2 Aircraft in Level to Adjacent Procedural FIRs
For aircraft operating in the enroute phase and entering **Mumbai** or **Sanaa** procedural airspace from the Muscat FIR, the following longitudinal separation minima shall apply:

- A standard separation of **80 NM** or **10 minutes** shall be maintained between aircraft.
- This may be reduced to:
    - **40 NM** or **5 minutes**, **provided** the leading aircraft is at least **20 knots faster** than the trailing aircraft.
    - **25 NM** or **3 minutes**, **provided** the leading aircraft is at least **40 knots faster** than the trailing aircraft.

These reduced minima shall only be applied when it is assured that the required speed differential is maintained throughout the period of reduced separation.

#### 2.2.2.2 Aircraft in Climbing or Descending Flight
Where aircraft are expected to pass through the level of another on the same airway in climbing or descending flight, where one aircraft is maintaining the same level, they shall be separated by a minimum of **10 NM**. 

### 2.2.3 Letters of Agreement
Where Letters of Agreement (LOAs) specify that aircraft shall be transferred with both **vertical and horizontal separation** established at the **coordinated level**, these minima **must be applied at all times**, unless alternate coordination has been explicitly agreed between the units involved.

Controllers shall ensure that any deviation from the standard separation or level transfer procedures is clearly coordinated and confirmed prior to handoff.

### 2.2.4 Separation from Adjacent Airspace
Except when a transfer of control has been coordinated, aircraft shall not be vectored closer than **2.5 NM** to the lateral boundary of a controllerâ€™s area of responsibility **without prior coordination** with the controller of the adjacent sector.

Controllers must ensure that any deviations from this rule are explicitly coordinated to maintain situational awareness and safe separation across sector boundaries.
