# 3. Sectorization
## 3.1 Designated Areas of Responsibility
### 3.1.2 General
To reduce workload during peak times, the Muscat FIR may be split into a maximum of seven sectors. Each sector is responsible for specific departures and arrivals and as such, shall comply with standard level clearance and handoff procedures to ensure separation. 

### 3.1.2 Coordination Between Controllers
Clearances to proceed direct to waypoints in adjacent sectors, radar vectors into adjacent sectors or deviation from standard level clearances shall not be given without prior coordination between the concerned controllers. 

Where handoffs are to be made between controllers, traffic shall be handed off to the next sector early enough such that they may conduct a continuous climb/descent provided no conflicts exist with other traffic and separation has been assured. 

## 3.2 Muscat ACC Sectors
### 3.2.1 Sector A
**Sector A** is the designated control area for traffic entering or exiting the Muscat FIR via **PARAR** and **RASKI**.

This sector progressively transitions from a **fully radar-controlled environment** to a **procedural (oceanic) sector** as aircraft approach the FIR boundary.

- **Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR)** coverage extends up to **100 NM** from Muscat.
- **Monopulse Secondary Surveillance Radar (MSSR)** coverage extends up to **256 NM**.
- Beyond these ranges, both radar and radio coverage degrade significantly.

Controllers shall ensure that **longitudinal separation minima**, as specified in **Section 2.2.2.2**, are applied to all aircraft entering procedural FIRs such as **Mumbai Oceanic**. Special attention must be given to maintaining safe separation as surveillance and communication capabilities diminish near the FIR boundary.

This sector is also responsible for arrivals into the Muscat TMA from the south-east.

### 3.2.2 Sector B
**Sector B** is the designated control area for traffic entering or exiting the Muscat FIR via **REXOD** and **TOTOX**.

This sector progressively transitions from a **fully radar-controlled environment** to a **procedural (oceanic) sector** as aircraft approach the FIR boundary.

- **Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR)** coverage extends up to **100 NM** from Muscat.
- **Monopulse Secondary Surveillance Radar (MSSR)** coverage extends up to **256 NM**.
- Beyond these ranges, both radar and radio coverage degrade significantly.

Controllers shall ensure that **longitudinal separation minima**, as specified in **Section 2.2.2.2**, are applied to all aircraft entering procedural FIRs such as **Mumbai Oceanic**. Particular attention must be given to maintaining safe separation as surveillance capabilities diminish.

This sector is also responsible for arrivals into the Muscat TMA from the south-east.

### 3.2.3 Sector C
**Sector C** is the designated control area for traffic entering or exiting the Muscat FIR via **MEMTU**, **LABRI**, **TARDI**, **RETAS**, and **MIDGU**.

This sector operates in a **fully radar-controlled environment** and primarily handles outbound traffic from the **Abu Dhabi TMA** and departures from the **Dubai TMA** routing southeast.

Controllers shall apply **longitudinal separation minima**, as specified in **Section 2.2.2**. Refer to the U.A.E. & Muscat Letter of Agreement (LoA) for further coordination requirements.

This sector is also responsible for arrivals into the Muscat TMA from the west.

### 3.2.4 Sector M
**Sector M** is the designated control area for traffic entering or exiting the Muscat FIR via **DAPOL**, **KITAL**, and **LOTAV**.

This sector progressively transitions from a **fully radar-controlled environment** to a **procedural (oceanic) sector** as aircraft approach the eastern FIR boundary.

- **Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR)** coverage extends up to **100 NM** from Muscat and Salalah.
- **Monopulse Secondary Surveillance Radar (MSSR)** coverage extends up to **256 NM**.
- Beyond these ranges, both radar and radio coverage degrade significantly.

Controllers shall ensure that **longitudinal separation minima**, as specified in **Section 2.2.2.2**, are applied to all aircraft entering procedural FIRs such as **Mumbai Oceanic**. Particular attention must be given to maintaining safe separation as surveillance and communication capabilities diminish near the FIR boundary.

### 3.2.5 Sector N
**Sector N** is the designated control area for traffic entering or exiting the Muscat FIR via **MESPO**, **DENDA**, and **TAPDO**.

This sector operates in a **fully radar-controlled environment** and handles inbound/outbound traffic from the **Muscat TMA** alongside enroute traffic.

Controllers shall apply **longitudinal separation minima**, as specified in **Section 2.2.2**. Refer to the U.A.E. & Muscat Letter of Agreement (LoA) for further coordination requirements.

This sector is also responsible for Muscat TMA arrivals from the west and acts as the **bandbox sector**, covering the entire Muscat FIR when no other sectors are online.

### 3.2.6 Sector S
**Sector S** is the designated control area for traffic entering or exiting the Muscat FIR via **ASPUX**, **GOBRO**, **IMDAM**, **IMKAD**, **KAPET**, **KIVEL**, **PUTRA**, **SABEL**, and **SITOL**.

This sector operates in a **fully radar-controlled environment** and manages mixed procedural traffic from the **Sanaa FIR** and inbound/outbound flows from the **Salalah TMA**.

Controllers shall apply **longitudinal separation minima**, as specified in **Section 2.2.2**. Particular care must be given to:

- Traffic entering radar-controlled airspace. Aircraft must be identified and assigned new squawk codes as they transition from procedural to radar control.

This sector is also responsible for arrivals into the **Salalah TMA**.

### 3.2.7 Sector W
**Sector W** is the designated control area for traffic entering or exiting the Muscat FIR via **IMLOT**, **LALDO**, and **TONVO**.

This sector operates in a **fully radar-controlled environment** and handles enroute traffic transiting or arriving into the **Dubai**, **Ras Al-Khaimah**, and **Fujairah TMAs**.

Controllers shall apply **longitudinal separation minima**, as specified in **Section 2.2.2**. Refer to the U.A.E. & Muscat Letter of Agreement (LoA) for further coordination requirements.

## 3.3 Muscat ACC Dynamic Sectorization
The Muscat FIR currently operates with fixed sector boundaries and does not utilize dynamic sectorization. Each sector is solely responsible for the management and control of its designated portion of airspace at all times, unless otherwise coordinated.

## 3.4 Sector Order
The Muscat FIR shall operate with the bandbox sector OOMM_1_CTR open at all times during ATC operations.

No additional sectors shall be activated unless explicit authorization is granted by the Arabian vACC staff team.

This policy ensures consistent coordination, efficient traffic handling, and proper airspace coverage. Any deviation from this configuration requires prior approval from the relevant vACC staff authority.
