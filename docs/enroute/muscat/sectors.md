## 3.3 Muscat ACC Dynamic Sectorization
The Muscat FIR currently operates with fixed sector boundaries and does not utilize dynamic sectorization. Each sector is solely responsible for the management and control of its designated portion of airspace at all times, unless otherwise coordinated.

## 3.4 Sector Order
The Muscat FIR shall operate with the bandbox sector OOMM_1_CTR open at all times during ATC operations.

No additional sectors shall be activated unless explicit authorization is granted by the Arabian vACC staff team.

This policy ensures consistent coordination, efficient traffic handling, and proper airspace coverage. Any deviation from this configuration requires prior approval from the relevant vACC staff authority.
