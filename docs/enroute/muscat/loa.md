### 2.2.3 Letters of Agreement
Where Letters of Agreement (LOAs) specify that aircraft shall be transferred with both **vertical and horizontal separation** established at the **coordinated level**, these minima **must be applied at all times**, unless alternate coordination has been explicitly agreed between the units involved.

Controllers shall ensure that any deviation from the standard separation or level transfer procedures is clearly coordinated and confirmed prior to handoff.

### 2.2.4 Separation from Adjacent Airspace
Except when a transfer of control has been coordinated, aircraft shall not be vectored closer than **2.5 NM** to the lateral boundary of a controllerâ€™s area of responsibility **without prior coordination** with the controller of the adjacent sector.

Controllers must ensure that any deviations from this rule are explicitly coordinated to maintain situational awareness and safe separation across sector boundaries.
