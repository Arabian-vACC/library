## 1.2 Sector Organization
To effectively manage traffic and reduce controller workload during peak periods, the Doha FIR may be divided into up to two sectors. Each sector is assigned responsibility for a specific traffic flow, such as departures, arrivals, or transit flights. Controllers within each sector must strictly adhere to established standard level clearance protocols and handoff procedures to maintain safe and efficient separation between aircraft. Additionally, sector controllers are responsible for continuous monitoring of their assigned traffic, timely coordination with adjacent sectors, and prompt communication of any deviations or potential conflicts. This sectorization approach ensures optimized traffic management, enhanced situational awareness, and maintains the highest standards of safety throughout the FIR.

## 1.3 Radar & Surveillance Systems
The Doha Flight Information Region (FIR) is equipped with a total of four MSSR (Monopulse Secondary Surveillance Radar) stations and three PSR (Primary Surveillance Radar) stations. The three primary PSR stations are strategically positioned to provide a detection range of up to 200 nautical miles (NM). Meanwhile, the four MSSR stations provide enhanced surveillance capabilities with a range extending up to 200 NM, allowing radar coverage within the entire FIR.

## 1.4 CPDLC/ADS-C
The Doha Flight Information Region (FIR) does not have operational CPDLC services in place. However, due to the increasing number of aircraft equipped with Hoppie ACARS, our sector files are configured to support CPDLC services enroute above FL295. This proactive configuration aims to accommodate the growing trend of aircraft utilizing CPDLC for communication, ensuring compatibility and readiness for future implementation.

Currently, the Doha FIR does not have ADS-C services implemented. Consequently, aircraft are required to comply with traditional voice reporting procedures for position reporting and coordination. There are no automatic position reporting systems in place within the FIR at this time.

In summary, while CPDLC and ADS-C services are not yet operational in the Doha FIR, the sector files are configured to support CPDLC services to align with the increasing number of equipped aircraft. However, ADS-C services are not currently available, and traditional voice communication remains the primary means for position reporting and coordination.

## 1.5 Flight Data Processing Systems
The Doha FIR utilizes the TopSky Air Traffic Management (ATM) system to support controllers in efficiently managing and tracking flights. TopSky consolidates flight plan information, continuously updates aircraft position data, and provides advanced conflict detection and resolution tools. Controllers rely on this system to maintain situational awareness, coordinate sector handoffs, and optimize traffic flow.

It is critical that aircraft tags within TopSky are kept current at all times. This includes accurate updates of cleared flight levels (CFL), direct routing to waypoints (COPX), headings, vertical speed rates, and speed or Mach number assignments. Maintaining these updates enables TopSky to perform reliable conflict prediction and issue timely alerts, thereby ensuring safe and efficient air traffic management throughout the FIR.

## 1.6 Controller Responsibilities
Controllers operating within the Doha FIR are responsible for ensuring the safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of air traffic within their designated sectors. This includes:

- Maintaining continuous surveillance and communication with all assigned aircraft.
- Issuing clearances, instructions, and traffic information in accordance with standard operating procedures.
- Monitoring compliance with level restrictions, route clearances, and separation minima.
- Coordinating timely handoffs with adjacent sectors to maintain seamless traffic flow.
- Managing traffic sequencing during peak periods and sector splits.
- Reporting any operational irregularities or emergencies promptly.
- Ensuring the effective use of available surveillance and communication technologies, including FDPS and CPDLC-enabled services where applicable.
