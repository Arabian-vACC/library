# 📢 Training Announcement – ATC Training Resumption

Dear Members,  

As many of you know, ATC training has been on hold for some time while we managed intake flow. The main reason for this pause was an imbalance between the number of students and the availability of mentors and instructors.  

During this period, the ATC Training Department has been working extensively to **rebuild the training program from scratch**. This includes:  

- Rewritten **session reports**  
- Detailed **syllabuses for each rating**  
- Comprehensive **self-study courses**  
- A brand-new **question bank** for Tier-1 theoretical exams (over **500+ questions**)  

---

## ✈️ Addressing the Core Issues

One of the biggest issues we identified was at the **S1 level**, where initial sessions were consumed by teaching theory. These sessions often lasted 2–3 hours covering knowledge that should have already been studied beforehand.  

To solve this:  

- **Self-study** is now emphasized as the foundation before mentoring begins.  
- All **initial training will take place outside of Dubai**, as Dubai’s complexity (layout, restrictions, RRSM, etc.) is not suitable for new controllers.  
- Controllers will be required to meet the **Dubai Tier-1 Endorsement requirements**, as outlined in the ATC Training Policy.

## 🖥️ Self-Study Courses & Seminars  

- **OBS → S1 Controllers** will have access to a new **Moodle self-study course** (👉 moodle.arabian-vacc.com).  
    - Access instructions are in the **Getting Started Guide** (please read it carefully).  
    - The course includes several modules covering most theoretical knowledge.  
    - Each module has **progress checks** to ensure proper understanding.  
    - The course is completed once the **MENA S1 theoretical exam** is passed.  

- **S2 and beyond:**  
    - No Moodle courses (yet) – these are still in development.  
    - Controllers will instead attend **seminars** covering the **core foundations** of each rating.  
    - Remember: SOPs for your designated training airport or TMA must be studied independently.
