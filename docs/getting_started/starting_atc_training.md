## Introduction

Looking to become an Air Traffic Controller on the VATSIM Network, controlling one of the Middle East's busiest airspaces? Here's everything you need to know to get started.

## 📌 Requirements & Expectations

Becoming a controller requires:

- Commitment
- Self-study
- A willingness to continuously learn

VATSIM follows a system of graduated ratings that determine the positions you can control, similar to real-world ATC training.

> **Important:** You must be a **resident of the Arabian vACC** before beginning ATC training.

Check your status and how to join here: [Joining Arabian](https://library.arabian-vacc.com/getting_started/joining_arabian/)

> Joining may take up to 72 hours. Transferring out will remove you from our waiting list and cancel your training eligibility.
