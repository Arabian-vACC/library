# Controller Conduct
## Scope
This document lays down the code of conduct all members, regardless of membership status, shall follow when controlling, training, or participating in any activities within the Arabian vACC. Arabian vACC staff reserve the right to revoke a controller’s approvals if any of these procedures are found to have been disregarded.

By being a member of the vACC pilots and controllers are bound by the procedures and requirements laid down in this policy. Failure to comply with this policy will result in the removal of controlling privileges in the Arabian vACC.
 
## Controllers
### Controller Conduct
All members shall follow the general points listed below:

1.	Members shall follow the VATSIM Code of Conduct.
2.	Members shall be in good standing with the Arabian vACC, VATMENA, VATEMEA and VATSIM.
3.	Any controller who, after careful investigation, has been found to have violated any article of the VATSIM Code of Conduct as either a controller, pilot or observer shall be immediately removed from the Arabian vACC roster without prior notice.
4.	Controllers shall always comply with all training standards and all policies found on the Arabian vACC official training system and all SOPs, vMATS, Operational Changes, and Letters of Agreement.
5.	Hate speech, violence, derogatory remarks, or personal attacks towards pilots on frequency shall result in termination of membership from the Arabian vACC without prejudice. A controller who has been found to be in violation of this requirement shall also be reported to the VATSIM network. 

In addition to this, all members shall follow the specific points listed herein. Failure to do so will result in disciplinary action and/or removal of controlling privileges within the Arabian vACC.

### Training Standards
The Arabian vACC strives to maintain an exceptional standard of controlling always and to closely mimic ATC operations in the real world.

Controllers shall always comply with the procedures laid down in the Arabian vMATS, SOPs, Operational Changes, and Letters of agreement. 

In addition, controllers shall always comply with Arabian Policy – Training Process for Home and Visitor Members and Arabian Policy – Controller Membership and Activity. 

### Spoken Language
The International civil aviation authority (ICAO) requires all pilots and controllers to communicate in English using ICAO standard phraseology, therefore the Arabian vACC requires all controllers to communicate in English when connected to the VATSIM network. Standard phraseology can be found in the Arabian Radiotelephony manual which controllers are always expected to follow.

### Staffing of controller positions
Controllers shall be expected to staff their online station for the full duration of their session. If a controller needs to step away for more than 5 minutes they shall disconnect from the network and only reconnect when they can staff the position without interruption.

Before disconnecting, controllers shall coordinate as provided in 1.6.2.

### Streaming controllers
To ensure the highest quality of controlling experience for pilots, controllers wish to stream to any online platform shall ensure their controlling duties take priority over stream-related chat or notifications.

Controllers who wish to stream shall ensure that they make any other members in the Discord coordination channel aware that they are streaming and have the consent of other members. Otherwise, streaming controllers shall move to a separate discord channel.

### Controller Coordination
#### Commencing a session
All controllers within the Arabian vACC are required to adhere to the following coordination procedure if they wish to open an ATC position. 

``` mermaid

   a[Controller checks out VATSIM Radar or equivalent to see if ATC is online] --> b[Adjacent controllers are online] --> c[Log on as an Observer] --> d[Coordinate with the next controller to determine ATIS, runways in use, and operational info] --> e[Log on desired position]
    a[Controller checks out VATSIM Radar or equivalent to see if ATC is online] --> f[Adjacent controllers are not online] --> e[Log on desired position]
```

Controllers should also check the Arabian vACC Discord server to see if the adjacent controller is in an Arabian vACC Coordination voice channel, if so, the controller wishing to open an adjacent position may coordinate in this way via voice.

If logging in as an observer, controllers shall allow enough time for Euroscope to update online ATC stations, and ensure that their visibility centres is set appropriately. Failure to comply with this requirement shall be considered a failure to coordinate.

#### Ending a session
Before ending a controlling session, controllers shall ensure they make other controllers aware that they shall be disconnecting by using the “.break” function on Euroscope and through voice (if available) at least 5 minutes prior to disconnecting from the position.
