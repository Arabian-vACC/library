## Scope
This syllabus outlines the structure and learning pathway for students pursuing the S1 rating within the Arabian vACC.

Students will achieve the course objectives through a combination of independent study and guided practical training. Core learning materials are provided via the Moodle platform and the Arabian vACC Library.

In addition to self-study, students will receive one-on-one practical instruction from mentors and instructors. Active participation and engagement are encouraged throughout your training.

Students are also encouraged to ask questions and seek support in the ATC Training category on the Arabian vACC Discord server.

!!! warning
    All documentation in this section is intended solely for use on the VATSIM network and must not be used for real-world aviation operations. The authors disclaim any liability for personal injury or death resulting from misuse of this material.

## Grading Criteria
Controllers will be graded during each session with a mentor or instructor. These evaluations are designed using Competency-Based Training and Assessment (CBTA) principles to ensure that controllers are progressing in both skills and knowledge.

The specific grading methods and criteria is defined in the Arabian vACC Training Policy.

| Session Objectives | - Discuss the purpose of flow management techniques, including the use of CTOTs and MDIs, and provide an introduction to the A-CDM concept.<br>- Explain the operational benefits of implementing flow control measures, particularly in managing demand and maintaining efficiency.<br>- Introduce the application of flow management techniques in high-traffic situations to help maintain orderly and safe operations.<br>- Review the overall objectives of the course and consolidate the student’s knowledge in preparation for the final exam.<br>- In most cases, students should be recommended for their exam at this stage. If it is clear they are not yet ready, conduct one additional consolidation session to address any remaining gaps. |
