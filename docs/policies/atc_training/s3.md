## Scope
This syllabus outlines the structure and learning pathway for students pursuing the S3 rating within the Arabian vACC.

Students will achieve the course objectives through a combination of independent study and guided practical training. Core learning materials are provided via the Moodle platform and the Arabian vACC Library.

In addition to self-study, students will receive one-on-one practical instruction from mentors and instructors. Active participation and engagement are encouraged throughout your training.

Students are also encouraged to ask questions and seek support in the ATC Training category on the Arabian vACC Discord server.

## Training Phases
The S3 Training Syllabus is divided into structured phases designed to standardise the approach training process and ensure full coverage of all required competencies. students are expected to complete each phase in sequence, focusing only on the competencies assigned to their current phase. Once the content of a phase has been completed and assessed, the student may progress to the next phase.

All phases must be successfully completed before a student can be recommended for a practical examination, unless a specific exception is granted. In total, the syllabus consists of three phases, each serving as a progressive building block toward exam readiness.

#### Progress Checks
Progress checks are conducted to verify competency within each phase of training and to ensure syllabus alignment. For Phase 1, checks shall be carried out on the Sweatbox server to avoid exposure to traffic scenarios outside the scope of that phase. For Phases 2 and 3, progress checks may be conducted either on the network (preferred) or on the Sweatbox server, depending on the traffic levels within the relevant CTA/TMA at the time of assessment.

The mentor or instructor administering the progress check should make every effort to assess the majority, if not all, of the learning objectives within that phase. Any objectives not assessed should be noted, and the mentor or instructor should use their professional judgement to determine whether additional training is required before progression.

As standard, when a student is deemed ready for the practical examination, their mentor or instructor will recommend them and a practical exam will be requested in accordance with the syllabus.

#### Session Guidance
The progression from **S2 to S3** represents the steepest learning curve that students will encounter during their ATC training within the Arabian vACC. To support this transition, mentors and instructors must ensure that students are **theoretically prepared** prior to beginning practical training and that **realistic expectations** are set for the first mentoring sessions.  

To guide this process, the following **do’s and don’ts** apply for the first S3 mentoring session:  

**Do’s** ✅

- Ensure that the student has correctly set up their **EuroScope** for the position they are training on. It is strongly recommended to use the pre-defined profiles, which are based on real-world displays and contain all essential information.  
- Discuss and verify the **core theoretical foundations** from Phase 1. A student who is knowledgeable and well-prepared will find the step-up significantly easier.  
- Set **realistic goals** for students. Since Phase 1 is a major component of the training, it will typically take several sessions to master the competencies in that phase.  
- **Pause sessions and correct mistakes early.** The sooner a student understands why a mistake occurred, the easier it will be for them to grasp more complex concepts later on.  

**Don’ts** ❌

- Put the student directly into a **Sweatbox session** without preparation. Early mistakes can damage confidence, and this initial period is crucial to build resilience.  
- Introduce **advanced competencies** from later phases. Focus exclusively on Phase 1 competencies until the student demonstrates mastery.  
- Expect the student to **know everything immediately.** Theoretical resources are valuable preparation tools, but they cannot replicate live controlling. Instead, guide students on how to find information, encourage curiosity, and discuss the reasons behind mistakes.  

### Phase 1: Core Foundations  
Phase 1 introduces the essential foundations of approach controlling. students focus on developing baseline competencies and system knowledge before progressing to more complex tasks.  

#### Aircraft Select (ASEL)  
Students must understand how to manipulate tags in EuroScope using keyboard commands.  

- **ASEL key** (default: NUMPAD +) selects aircraft by typing part of the callsign and cycling through matches.  
- **Assuming an uncorrelated target**:  

    1. Ensure the chat bar is empty and type the callsign.  
    2. Press **ASEL (NUMPAD +)**.  
    3. Press **F3**.  
    4. Press **ASEL** again.  

- This action populates the sector list and allows squawk assignment.  
- If no NUMPAD is available, the ASEL key can be reassigned under: **Other Set → General Settings → Aircraft Select Key**.  

#### Airspace Classification  
Students must know where to locate different classes of controlled airspace (via local AIPs) and be able to explain their main features and operational implications.  

#### Contacting & Identifying Aircraft from Uncontrolled Airspace  
Students must be able to:  

- Send **“contact me” messages** to aircraft in uncontrolled airspace.  
- Complete valid identification using squawks or correlation.  
- Assign squawks via the **TopSky ASSR menu** if none are allocated.  

Uncorrelated aircraft not on the sector list can be assumed by either:  

1. **Manual correlation** – click the target, type the callsign, then select *Assume*.  
2. **Uncorrelated assumption** – type part of the callsign → press **ASEL (NUMPAD +)** → **F3** → **ASEL**.  

#### Distance & Separation Tools  
Students must know how to access and use **TopSky tools** to check distance and separation:  

- **ALT + Right Click → TopSky Radar Menu → QDM or SEP**.  

#### Forward Planning  
Students must demonstrate the ability to:  

- Anticipate landing order early.  
- Apply vectors and speed control to achieve the planned sequence.  
- Adjust the plan when necessary.  
- Use either visual estimation (*“eyeballing”*) or mileage calculations (*“counting the miles”*).  

#### Local CTA/TMA Knowledge  
Students must understand and apply local procedures, including:  

- **Silent release, full release, full/reduced radar handover**.  
- Coordination between **APP and FIN** positions when both are staffed.  
- Awareness of **VRPs and common VFR routings** (e.g., Dubai CTA VFR routes).  
- Standard spacing requirements, **LVPs**, and related increases in spacing.  

#### Maintaining Separation  
Students must:  

- Apply correct **separation minima** and know when reduced minima are permitted.  
- Recognize when separation is at risk and take corrective action.  
- Use EuroScope’s separation tools effectively.  

#### Mode S Correlation  
Mode S correlation is **mandatory** during S3 training.  

- By default, approach profiles should have Mode S enabled.  
- To verify: **Other Set → General Settings → Correlation Mode → S-Mode**.  

#### Radar Identification  
Students must understand identification principles and limitations:  

- **Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR):** identification via radar returns.  
- **Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) / Multilateration (MLAT):** identification via transponder replies.  
- **Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast (ADS-B):** identification via ADS-B data.  

Automated ATS systems indicate the sensor type(s) in use (PSR, SSR/MLAT, ADS-B, or combined). Controllers must:  

- Select an appropriate identification method.  
- Recognize limitations of each procedure.  
- Switch methods if the chosen one does not yield satisfactory identification.  

**Validation:**  
- Understand validation procedures and when squawks are deemed validated.  
- Recognize conspicuous codes (e.g., 2000, 7000) and avoid using them for identification.  
- Explain the role of conspicuous and listening squawks.  

**Verification:**  
- Use Mode C for vertical verification.  
- Verify the level of pilots new to approach control on first contact.  
- Require altitude/level reports if not provided.  
- Provide local QNH if below the transition level.  

#### Radiotelephony
Students must demonstrate professional and accurate use of R/T, including:  

**Phraseology:**  
- Standard phraseology as defined in:  
  - ICAO Annex 10, Vol II, Ch. 5  
  - ICAO Doc 4444, Ch. 12  
  - ICAO Doc 9432, Manual of Radiotelephony  

**Frequency Presence & Attitude:**  
- Be polite but assertive when required.  
- Avoid referencing past instructions if a pilot deviated, to prevent confusion.  

**Frequency Management:**  
- Manage transmissions to maintain order.  
- In cases of frequency blocking, prioritize one transmission, then return to the other aircraft.  

#### Speed Control  
Students must apply standard speed control techniques:  

- Use “hard speeds” where necessary to maintain spacing, establish landing order, or regulate approach flow.  
- Allow pilots to manage their own speed outside these criteria.  

**Standard Speeds:**  
- Downwind: **230–210 knots**  
- Base: **180 knots**  
- Final: **160 knots until 4 DME**  

**Tag Denotation:**  
- Apply speed restrictions via TopSky tags using exact values or less than or greater than (- / +).  

#### Tag Management  
Approach tags must mirror real-world counterparts. Correct configuration is critical, as tag families apply different **wake turbulence categories** per airspace.  

- Example: **RECAT** in Doha TMA.  
- Example: **Standard ICAO** in Abu Dhabi CTA.  

#### Useful Links  
- [Euroscope Wiki](https://www.euroscope.hu/wp/documentation-about-euroscope/)  
- TopSky Documentation (included in the sector file)  

Note: While in-depth EuroScope knowledge is not required, familiarity with these features significantly aids in radar controlling.  

#### Vectoring, Descents & ILS Approach  
Students must:  
- Keep aircraft within controlled airspace and their area of responsibility.  
- Avoid instructions that conflict with inbound release procedures, local restrictions, or separation requirements.  
- Apply correct platform altitudes and Final Approach Fix (FAF) positions for each runway.  
- Establish aircraft on the ILS localiser with a maximum intercept angle of **45°**.  
- Sequence descents along a **3° glide path** (using the 3-to-1 rule: 1000 ft lost per 3 NM).  
- Use appropriate phraseology throughout.  

### Phase 2: Additional Knowledge
Phase 2 builds upon the skills mastered in Phase 1, extending the student’s knowledge from foundational competencies to more advanced and practical applications.

#### Holding Procedures
Students must be familiar with holding facilities in their training CTA/TMA, including:  

- Directions  
- Levels  
- Speeds  

They should also understand the different methods of entering and leaving a hold:  

- Fly heading  
- Direct entry  
- Leaving the hold  

More value is gained when the student determines **when** to initiate a hold, rather than simply practicing clear-out scenarios. This decision-making focus ensures deeper understanding and readiness for real-world situations.  

#### Non-Standard Approaches
Students must be able to correctly sequence and position aircraft for **non-standard or procedural approaches**. Key competencies include:  

- Ensuring traffic safety and understanding the impact of such approaches on overall flow.  
- Using holds when traffic density prevents immediate clearance for a procedural approach.  
- Providing clear and concise traffic information where applicable.  
- Correctly reading charts for:  
  - Approach type  
  - Final approach track (including any offset)  
  - Platform altitude  
  - Missed approach procedure  

Additional considerations:  

- QNH must be provided at the appropriate time, with understanding of why it is required.  
- The procedure must establish the aircraft at platform altitude or at a safe altitude to fly the profile.  
- If the missed approach procedure differs from the ILS, Tower must be notified of the non-standard approach.  
- RVR limitations apply for visual approaches; field in sight is not required.  

#### Traffic Information
Students must be able to deliver accurate and timely traffic information, including:  

- **Clock code** (position reference)  
- **Range** (distance)  
- **Direction of travel**  
- **Altitude**  
  - Use *“indicating”* if no Mode C verification  
  - Use *“no height information”* for PSR-only returns  

#### Flight Information Service (FIS)
Students must understand the role and provision of **Flight Information Service**, and be able to explain:  

- Applicable flight rules (VFR/IFR)  
- Surveillance vs. non-surveillance environments  
- Terrain clearance responsibilities  
- Ability to provide vectors and levels for sequencing  

### Phase 3: Consolidation & Network Practice
In this phase, students will participate in multiple one-to-one mentoring sessions designed to consolidate the skills gained in Phases 1 and 2, with an emphasis on applying them in live network traffic scenarios. Mentors will adapt each session to the student's individual strengths and development needs, with the ultimate objective of preparing the student for solo validation by the end of this phase.

#### Solo Validation: Approach
**As students approach the final stage of training, they may be granted a Solo Approach Validation.**  
This is a time-limited endorsement that authorises the student to control independently on the tower position for which they are training.  

- Each validation is issued for a **maximum of 30 days** from the mentoring session in which it was recommended.  
- Across the entire tower training programme, a student may hold up to **90 days of solo validation in total**.  

#### Pre-CPT Check
The Pre-CPT check, as outlined in the VATMENA ATC Training Policy, serves as a **training checkpoint** to assess a student’s readiness before scheduling their practical examination for the relevant rating.  

- The Pre-CPT acts as a **mock practical exam**, allowing students to demonstrate their skills prior to the official evaluation.  
- It should ideally be conducted on the **live network**, though the **Sweatbox server** may be used if necessary.  
- The choice of environment should consider **traffic levels at the aerodrome** at that time.  
- If the student is deemed ready, the mentor or instructor will forward them to the **relevant channel** for the official examination.
