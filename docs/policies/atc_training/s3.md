## Scope
Welcome to the Arabian vACC ATC Training Policy. This document serves as a comprehensive guide for all aspiring and current controllers within the vACC. Whether you are just beginning your journey as a Student Controller or progressing toward Center positions, this policy will outline the expectations, procedures, and pathways that support your growth and success within the network.

Our training spans three key FIRs across the Middle East: Doha (OTDF), Muscat (OOMM), and the United Arab Emirates (OMAE). Through consistent standards, region-specific procedures, and a focus on real-world accuracy, we aim to deliver a high-quality experience that mirrors real ATC operations while being accessible to all levels of experience.

Our approach balances theory and practice, with a progression system designed to build your skills one rating at a time. This policy will guide you through that journey — from initial onboarding to rating advancement, endorsement acquisition, and beyond.

!!! warning
    All documentation in this section is intended solely for use on the VATSIM network and must not be used for real-world aviation operations. The authors disclaim any liability for personal injury or death resulting from misuse of this material.

## Grading Criteria
Controllers will be graded during each session with a mentor or instructor. These evaluations are designed using Competency-Based Training and Assessment (CBTA) principles to ensure that controllers are progressing in both skills and knowledge.

The specific grading methods and criteria is defined in the Arabian vACC Training Policy.

## Training Phases
The S3 Training Syllabus is divided into structured phases designed to standardise the approach training process and ensure full coverage of all required competencies. Trainees are expected to complete each phase in sequence, focusing only on the competencies assigned to their current phase. Once the content of a phase has been completed and assessed, the trainee may progress to the next phase.

All phases must be successfully completed before a trainee can be recommended for a practical examination, unless a specific exception is granted. In total, the syllabus consists of three phases, each serving as a progressive building block toward exam readiness.

#### Progress Checks
Progress checks are conducted to verify competency within each phase of training and to ensure syllabus alignment. For Phase 1, checks shall be carried out on the Sweatbox server to avoid exposure to traffic scenarios outside the scope of that phase. For Phases 2 and 3, progress checks may be conducted either on the network (preferred) or on the Sweatbox server, depending on the traffic levels within the relevant CTA/TMA at the time of assessment.

The mentor or instructor administering the progress check should make every effort to assess the majority, if not all, of the learning objectives within that phase. Any objectives not assessed should be noted, and the mentor or instructor should use their professional judgement to determine whether additional training is required before progression.

As standard, when a student is deemed ready for the practical examination, their mentor or instructor will recommend them and a practical exam will be requested in accordance with the syllabus.

#### Session Guidance
The progression from **S2 to S3** represents the steepest learning curve that trainees will encounter during their ATC training within the Arabian vACC. To support this transition, mentors and instructors must ensure that students are **theoretically prepared** prior to beginning practical training and that **realistic expectations** are set for the first mentoring sessions.  

To guide this process, the following **do’s and don’ts** apply for the first S3 mentoring session:  

**Do’s** ✅

- Ensure that the student has correctly set up their **EuroScope** for the position they are training on. It is strongly recommended to use the pre-defined profiles, which are based on real-world displays and contain all essential information.  
- Discuss and verify the **core theoretical foundations** from Phase 1. A student who is knowledgeable and well-prepared will find the step-up significantly easier.  
- Set **realistic goals** for students. Since Phase 1 is a major component of the training, it will typically take several sessions to master the competencies in that phase.  
- **Pause sessions and correct mistakes early.** The sooner a student understands why a mistake occurred, the easier it will be for them to grasp more complex concepts later on.  

**Don’ts** ❌

- Put the student directly into a **Sweatbox session** without preparation. Early mistakes can damage confidence, and this initial period is crucial to build resilience.  
- Introduce **advanced competencies** from later phases. Focus exclusively on Phase 1 competencies until the student demonstrates mastery.  
- Expect the student to **know everything immediately.** Theoretical resources are valuable preparation tools, but they cannot replicate live controlling. Instead, guide students on how to find information, encourage curiosity, and discuss the reasons behind mistakes.  

### Phase 1: Core Foundations  
Phase 1 introduces the essential foundations of approach controlling. Trainees focus on developing baseline competencies and system knowledge before progressing to more complex tasks.  

The objectives below are presented in alphabetical order for clarity.  

#### Aircraft Select (ASEL)  
Students must understand how to manipulate tags in EuroScope using keyboard commands.  

- **ASEL key** (default: NUMPAD +) selects aircraft by typing part of the callsign and cycling through matches.  
- **Assuming an uncorrelated target**:  
  1. Ensure the chat bar is empty and type the callsign.  
  2. Press **ASEL (NUMPAD +)**.  
  3. Press **F3**.  
  4. Press **ASEL** again.  
- This action populates the sector list and allows squawk assignment.  
- If no NUMPAD is available, the ASEL key can be reassigned under: **Other Set → General Settings → Aircraft Select Key**.  

#### Airspace Classification  
Students must know where to locate different classes of controlled airspace (via local AIPs) and be able to explain their main features and operational implications.  

#### Contacting & Identifying Aircraft from Uncontrolled Airspace  
Students must be able to:  

- Send **“contact me” messages** to aircraft in uncontrolled airspace.  
- Complete valid identification using squawks or correlation.  
- Assign squawks via the **TopSky ASSR menu** if none are allocated.  

Uncorrelated aircraft not on the sector list can be assumed by either:  

1. **Manual correlation** – click the target, type the callsign, then select *Assume*.  
2. **Uncorrelated assumption** – type part of the callsign → press **ASEL (NUMPAD +)** → **F3** → **ASEL**.  

#### Distance & Separation Tools  
Students must know how to access and use **TopSky tools** to check distance and separation:  

- **ALT + Right Click → TopSky Radar Menu → QDM or SEP**.  

#### Forward Planning  
Students must demonstrate the ability to:  

- Anticipate landing order early.  
- Apply vectors and speed control to achieve the planned sequence.  
- Adjust the plan when necessary.  
- Use either visual estimation (*“eyeballing”*) or mileage calculations (*“counting the miles”*).  

#### Local CTA/TMA Knowledge  
Students must understand and apply local procedures, including:  

- **Silent release, full release, full/reduced radar handover**.  
- Coordination between **APP and FIN** positions when both are staffed.  
- Awareness of **VRPs and common VFR routings** (e.g., Dubai CTA VFR routes).  
- Standard spacing requirements, **LVPs**, and related increases in spacing.  

#### Maintaining Separation  
Students must:  

- Apply correct **separation minima** and know when reduced minima are permitted.  
- Recognize when separation is at risk and take corrective action.  
- Use EuroScope’s separation tools effectively.  

#### Mode S Correlation  
Mode S correlation is **mandatory** during S3 training.  

- By default, approach profiles should have Mode S enabled.  
- To verify: **Other Set → General Settings → Correlation Mode → S-Mode**.  

#### Radar Identification  
Students must understand identification principles and limitations:  

- **Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR):** identification via radar returns.  
- **Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) / Multilateration (MLAT):** identification via transponder replies.  
- **Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast (ADS-B):** identification via ADS-B data.  

Automated ATS systems indicate the sensor type(s) in use (PSR, SSR/MLAT, ADS-B, or combined). Controllers must:  

- Select an appropriate identification method.  
- Recognize limitations of each procedure.  
- Switch methods if the chosen one does not yield satisfactory identification.  

**Validation:**  
- Understand validation procedures and when squawks are deemed validated.  
- Recognize conspicuous codes (e.g., 2000, 7000) and avoid using them for identification.  
- Explain the role of conspicuous and listening squawks.  

**Verification:**  
- Use Mode C for vertical verification.  
- Verify the level of pilots new to approach control on first contact.  
- Require altitude/level reports if not provided.  
- Provide local QNH if below the transition level.  

#### Radiotelephony (R/T)  
Students must demonstrate professional and accurate use of R/T, including:  

**Phraseology:**  
- Standard phraseology as defined in:  
  - ICAO Annex 10, Vol II, Ch. 5  
  - ICAO Doc 4444, Ch. 12  
  - ICAO Doc 9432, Manual of Radiotelephony  

**Frequency Presence & Attitude:**  
- Be polite but assertive when required.  
- Avoid referencing past instructions if a pilot deviated, to prevent confusion.  

**Frequency Management:**  
- Manage transmissions to maintain order.  
- In cases of frequency blocking, prioritize one transmission, then return to the other aircraft.  

#### Speed Control  
Students must apply standard speed control techniques:  

- Use “hard speeds” where necessary to maintain spacing, establish landing order, or regulate approach flow.  
- Allow pilots to manage their own speed outside these criteria.  

**Standard Speeds:**  
- Downwind: **230–210 knots**  
- Base: **180 knots**  
- Final: **160 knots until 4 DME**  

**Tag Denotation:**  
- Apply speed restrictions via TopSky tags using exact values or less than or greater than (- / +).  

#### Tag Management  
Approach tags must mirror real-world counterparts. Correct configuration is critical, as tag families apply different **wake turbulence categories** per airspace.  

- Example: **RECAT** in Doha TMA.  
- Example: **Standard ICAO** in Abu Dhabi CTA.  

#### Useful Links  
- [Euroscope Wiki](https://www.euroscope.hu/wp/documentation-about-euroscope/)  
- TopSky Documentation (included in the sector file)  

Note: While in-depth EuroScope knowledge is not required, familiarity with these features significantly aids in radar controlling.  

#### Vectoring, Descents & ILS Approach  
Students must:  
- Keep aircraft within controlled airspace and their area of responsibility.  
- Avoid instructions that conflict with inbound release procedures, local restrictions, or separation requirements.  
- Apply correct platform altitudes and Final Approach Fix (FAF) positions for each runway.  
- Establish aircraft on the ILS localiser with a maximum intercept angle of **45°**.  
- Sequence descents along a **3° glide path** (using the 3-to-1 rule: 1000 ft lost per 3 NM).  
- Use appropriate phraseology throughout.
