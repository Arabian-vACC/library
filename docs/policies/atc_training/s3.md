## Scope
Welcome to the Arabian vACC ATC Training Policy. This document serves as a comprehensive guide for all aspiring and current controllers within the vACC. Whether you are just beginning your journey as a Student Controller or progressing toward Center positions, this policy will outline the expectations, procedures, and pathways that support your growth and success within the network.

Our training spans three key FIRs across the Middle East: Doha (OTDF), Muscat (OOMM), and the United Arab Emirates (OMAE). Through consistent standards, region-specific procedures, and a focus on real-world accuracy, we aim to deliver a high-quality experience that mirrors real ATC operations while being accessible to all levels of experience.

Our approach balances theory and practice, with a progression system designed to build your skills one rating at a time. This policy will guide you through that journey — from initial onboarding to rating advancement, endorsement acquisition, and beyond.

!!! warning
    All documentation in this section is intended solely for use on the VATSIM network and must not be used for real-world aviation operations. The authors disclaim any liability for personal injury or death resulting from misuse of this material.

## Grading Criteria
Controllers will be graded during each session with a mentor or instructor. These evaluations are designed using Competency-Based Training and Assessment (CBTA) principles to ensure that controllers are progressing in both skills and knowledge.

The specific grading methods and criteria is defined in the Arabian vACC Training Policy.

## Theoretical Course
The following list outlines the theoretical topics covered in the S3 Rating course available on the Moodle platform.

(Draft in Progress)

## Required Reading
In addition to the Moodle course, students shall read the following documentation in preparation for the practical training phase.

## Training Phases
The S3 Training Syllabus is divided into structured phases designed to standardise the approach training process and ensure full coverage of all required competencies. Trainees are expected to complete each phase in sequence, focusing only on the competencies assigned to their current phase. Once the content of a phase has been completed and assessed, the trainee may progress to the next phase.

All phases must be successfully completed before a trainee can be recommended for a practical examination, unless a specific exception is granted. In total, the syllabus consists of three phases, each serving as a progressive building block toward exam readiness.

#### Progress Checks
Progress checks are conducted to verify competency within each phase of training and to ensure syllabus alignment. For Phase 1, checks shall be carried out on the Sweatbox server to avoid exposure to traffic scenarios outside the scope of that phase. For Phases 2 and 3, progress checks may be conducted either on the network (preferred) or on the Sweatbox server, depending on the traffic levels within the relevant CTA/TMA at the time of assessment.

The mentor or instructor administering the progress check should make every effort to assess the majority, if not all, of the learning objectives within that phase. Any objectives not assessed should be noted, and the mentor or instructor should use their professional judgement to determine whether additional training is required before progression.

As standard, when a student is deemed ready for the practical examination, their mentor or instructor will recommend them and a practical exam will be requested in accordance with the syllabus.

#### Session Guidance
The progression from **S2 to S3** represents the steepest learning curve that trainees will encounter during their ATC training within the Arabian vACC. To support this transition, mentors and instructors must ensure that students are **theoretically prepared** prior to beginning practical training and that **realistic expectations** are set for the first mentoring sessions.  

To guide this process, the following **do’s and don’ts** apply for the first S3 mentoring session:  

**Do’s** ✅
- Ensure that the student has correctly set up their **EuroScope** for the position they are training on. It is strongly recommended to use the pre-defined profiles, which are based on real-world displays and contain all essential information.  
- Discuss and verify the **core theoretical foundations** from Phase 1. A student who is knowledgeable and well-prepared will find the step-up significantly easier.  
- Set **realistic goals** for students. Since Phase 1 is a major component of the training, it will typically take several sessions to master the competencies in that phase.  
- **Pause sessions and correct mistakes early.** The sooner a student understands why a mistake occurred, the easier it will be for them to grasp more complex concepts later on.  

**Don’ts** ❌
- Put the student directly into a **Sweatbox session** without preparation. Early mistakes can damage confidence, and this initial period is crucial to build resilience.  
- Introduce **advanced competencies** from later phases. Focus exclusively on Phase 1 competencies until the student demonstrates mastery.  
- Expect the student to **know everything immediately.** Theoretical resources are valuable preparation tools, but they cannot replicate live controlling. Instead, guide students on how to find information, encourage curiosity, and discuss the reasons behind mistakes.  

### Phase 1: Core Foundations
During this Phase, Phase 1 focuses on the core foundations of approach controlling and a list of items covered with useful links which are found below:

#### Use of Euroscope & TopSky
##### Mode S  
During **S3 training**, Mode S correlation is **mandatory**. By default, all approach position profiles should have this enabled. This can be verified under:  
**Other Set → General Settings → Correlation Mode → S-Mode**.  

##### Tag Management  
Approach **tags** are based on their real-world counterparts and must be set correctly. Different tag families incorporate **wake turbulence categories** according to local airspace requirements.  
- Example: **RECAT** in the Doha TMA  
- Example: **Standard ICAO** in the Abu Dhabi CTA  

##### Distance & Separation Tools  
**TopSky distance and separation tools** can be accessed via:  
- **ALT + Right Click** → TopSky Radar Menu → **QDM** or **SEP**  

##### Contacting & Identifying Aircraft from Uncontrolled Airspace  
Students must be able to send **“contact me” messages** to aircraft in uncontrolled airspace and complete valid identification.  
- If a **squawk is not assigned**, students should assign one using the **TopSky ASSR menu**.  

For aircraft **not on the sector list** and uncorrelated, two methods of assumption are available:  
1. **Manual correlation** – click the target, type the callsign, then select *Assume*.  
2. **Uncorrelated assumption** – type part of the callsign, press **ASEL (NUMPAD +)** → **F3** → **ASEL** again.
