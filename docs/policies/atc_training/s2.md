## Scope
This syllabus outlines the structure and learning pathway for students pursuing the S2 rating within the Arabian vACC.

Students will achieve the course objectives through a combination of independent study and guided practical training. Core learning materials are provided via the Moodle platform and the Arabian vACC Library.

In addition to self-study, students will receive one-on-one practical instruction from mentors and instructors. Active participation and engagement are encouraged throughout your training.

Students are also encouraged to ask questions and seek support in the ATC Training category on the Arabian vACC Discord server.

!!! warning
    All documentation in this section is intended solely for use on the VATSIM network and must not be used for real-world aviation operations. The authors disclaim any liability for personal injury or death resulting from misuse of this material.

## Grading Criteria
Controllers will be graded during each session with a mentor or instructor. These evaluations are designed using Competency-Based Training and Assessment (CBTA) principles to ensure that controllers are progressing in both skills and knowledge.

The specific grading methods and criteria is defined in the Arabian vACC Training Policy.

## Theoretical Course
The following list outlines the theoretical topics covered in the S2 Rating course available on the Moodle platform.

### Aerodrome SOP
Specific SOP for the student's designated training aerodrome.

## Training Phases
### Phase 1: Basic Simulator Training
During this phase, students will complete 2â€“3 SweatBox sessions. These sessions provide the opportunity to practice all the required skills for Tower (TWR) within the Arabian vACC. Training will take place on the SweatBox server in a one-to-one environment with a mentor. Mentoring sessions at this stage will focus primarily on the practical application of controlling techniques, ensuring students can effectively translate theoretical knowledge into operational performance.

#### Self-Study
Students are expected to arrive at each session with a solid understanding of the relevant theory.  

- If a student lacks the required pre-requisite knowledge, the session may be concluded early or rescheduled.  
- Being well-prepared allows students to gain the maximum benefit from each session while also ensuring that mentorsâ€™ time is used effectively.  

The level of self-study required in this block will be significantly greater than in the previous one. Although the exact time commitment will vary between individuals, students should plan to dedicate approximately **an equal amount of time to self-study as to mentoring sessions**.  

ðŸ‘‰ For example: for every **1.5-hour mentoring session**, students should spend around **1.5 hours reviewing material, consolidating knowledge, and preparing for the next session**.  

### Phase 2: Consolidation & Network Practice
During this phase, students will take part in multiple one-to-one mentoring sessions aimed at consolidating the skills developed in Phase 1, with a particular focus on applying them to live network traffic. Mentors will tailor the content of these sessions to the individual studentâ€™s strengths and areas for improvement.

For students who actively engage in sessions and maintain consistent self-study, this phase is expected to require 3 to 5 sessions.

#### Solo Validation: Tower
**As students approach the final stage of training, they may be granted a Solo Tower Validation.**  
This is a time-limited endorsement that authorises the student to control independently on the tower position for which they are training.  

- Each validation is issued for a **maximum of 30 days** from the mentoring session in which it was recommended.  
- Across the entire tower training programme, a student may hold up to **90 days of solo validation in total**.  

#### Self-Study
**During this phase, self-study remains highly important.**  
By this stage, students are expected to already have a solid understanding of:  

- All theoretical material required for S2 training.  
- The designated **vMATS Part 1 & Part 2** content.  
- The Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for their assigned aerodrome.  

Self-study at this point should primarily focus on **keeping knowledge current** and **reviewing any areas of difficulty** identified during previous mentoring sessions.  

#### Pre-CPT Check
The Pre-CPT check, as outlined in the VATMENA ATC Training Policy, serves as a **training checkpoint** to assess a studentâ€™s readiness before scheduling their practical examination for the relevant rating.  

- The Pre-CPT acts as a **mock practical exam**, allowing students to demonstrate their skills prior to the official evaluation.  
- It should ideally be conducted on the **live network**, though the **Sweatbox server** may be used if necessary.  
- The choice of environment should consider **traffic levels at the aerodrome** at that time.  
- If the student is deemed ready, the mentor or instructor will forward them to the **relevant channel** for the official examination.
