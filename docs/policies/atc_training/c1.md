## Scope
This syllabus outlines the structure and learning pathway for students pursuing the C1 rating within the Arabian vACC.

Students will achieve the course objectives through a combination of independent study and guided practical training. Core learning materials are provided via the Moodle platform and the Arabian vACC Library.

In addition to self-study, students will receive one-on-one practical instruction from mentors and instructors. Active participation and engagement are encouraged throughout your training.

Students are also encouraged to ask questions and seek support in the ATC Training category on the Arabian vACC Discord server.

!!! warning
    All documentation in this section is intended solely for use on the VATSIM network and must not be used for real-world aviation operations. The authors disclaim any liability for personal injury or death resulting from misuse of this material.

## Grading Criteria
Controllers will be graded during each session with a mentor or instructor. These evaluations are designed using Competency-Based Training and Assessment (CBTA) principles to ensure that controllers are progressing in both skills and knowledge.

The specific grading methods and criteria is defined in the Arabian vACC Training Policy.

## Theoretical Course
The following list outlines the theoretical topics covered in the C1 Rating course available on the Moodle platform.

(Draft in Progress)

## Learning Objectives
### Releases
The student should understand the following releases:

- Full release
- Turn release
- Climb/descent release

### Standing Agreements
The student should know the agreed levels relevant to their sectors. The student demonstrates an understanding of uncommon standing agreements. Examples of uncommon
agreements are those that are rarely used, those that vary depending on the situation (e.g. cruising level
specific agreements into Doha) or involve multiple components (e.g. headings towards a certain fix or an airway requiring an airways clearance).

### Standard Routings
The student should know the SIDs and STARs releveant to their sector, including any restrictions where appropriate

### Enroute Holding
The student should be able to describe any published enroute hold.

### Altimetry
The student should be able to define the following terms:

- Transition Altitude
- Transition Level
- Minimum Holding Altitude/Level

Students should be able to give the minimum stack level for the aerodromes or CTAs/TMAs under their control.

#### Radar Identification  
Students must understand identification principles and limitations:  

- **Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR):** identification via radar returns.  
- **Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) / Multilateration (MLAT):** identification via transponder replies.  
- **Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast (ADS-B):** identification via ADS-B data.  

Automated ATS systems indicate the sensor type(s) in use (PSR, SSR/MLAT, ADS-B, or combined). Controllers must:  

- Select an appropriate identification method.  
- Recognize limitations of each procedure.  
- Switch methods if the chosen one does not yield satisfactory identification.  

**Validation:**  
- Understand validation procedures and when squawks are deemed validated.  
- Recognize conspicuous codes (e.g., 2000, 7000) and avoid using them for identification.  
- Explain the role of conspicuous and listening squawks.  

**Verification:**  
- Use Mode C for vertical verification.  
- Verify the level of pilots new to approach control on first contact.  
- Require altitude/level reports if not provided.  
- Provide local QNH if below the transition level.  

#### Flight Information Service (FIS)
Students must understand the role and provision of **Flight Information Service**, and be able to explain:  

- Applicable flight rules (VFR/IFR)  
- Surveillance vs. non-surveillance environments  
- Terrain clearance responsibilities  
- Ability to provide vectors and levels for sequencing  

#### Professionalism and Attitude
The student remains calm and courteous at all times, even when a pilot or adjacent controller makes a
mistake.

#### Use of Standard Radiotelephony
Instructions are given using standard RT. They are unambiguous, decisive and do not contain superfluous
words that add nothing to the value of the transmission

#### Pace and Clarity
The pace of transmission is consistent, and the student clearly demonstrates that they plan what they’re going
to say before the say it. The student makes good use of alias files for prompt transmissions.

#### Use of Datablocks
If the student elects not to use certain aspects of the datablock with a justified reason, they should be able to
explain the conventions for using them. Students are, however, encouraged to use scratchpads and other
aspects to aid their own situational awareness.
The student utilises the heading, altitude and speed blocks and keeps them promptly up to date. When using
soft speeds, they follow the standard conventions.

#### Climbs & Descents with respect to Local Airspace
The student keeps aircraft within controlled airspace and their sector and does not issue any instructions that
could lead to this not being the case

#### Presentation of Traffic
The student demonstrates an understanding of the next controller’s requirements and manoeuvres aircraft
such that they are in an optimal position for onward travel. For example, they may position aircraft in parallel, positioned in accordance with the direction that they will eventually turn further down route. An alternative
example would be the controller “starting off” headings to place the aircraft in an optimal position for the next
control - i.e. the beginning of a parallel stream

#### Ensuring Separation
The student consistently ensures separation, especially in regard to making sure headings or speeds have
worked before removing vertical separation. In the event that they give an unsafe instruction, it is immediately
corrected. If challenged over whether a particular situation is a failure to ensure separation (whether it is or
not), the student gives a confident, justified answer.

#### Issuing of STARs
The student re-assigns a STAR on the occasion that the pilot has filed a routing for a STAR that is inappropriate
for their flight.

#### Coordination with Approach Units
All coordination is done where appropriate and is clear and concise

#### Coordination with Enroute Units
Examples of coordination: Releases, non-standard flights, coordinating a higher level when handoff is delayed,
coordinating shortcuts.

All coordination is done where appropriate and is clear and concise. In cases where verbal coordination is
inappropriate, the student makes use of their controller clients inbuilt coordination functionality.

In addition to the Moodle course, students shall read the following documentation in preparation for the practical training phase.
