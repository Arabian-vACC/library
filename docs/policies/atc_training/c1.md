## Scope
This syllabus outlines the structure and learning pathway for students pursuing the C1 rating within the Arabian vACC.

Students will achieve the course objectives through a combination of independent study and guided practical training. Core learning materials are provided via the Moodle platform and the Arabian vACC Library.

In addition to self-study, students will receive one-on-one practical instruction from mentors and instructors. Active participation and engagement are encouraged throughout your training.

Students are also encouraged to ask questions and seek support in the ATC Training category on the Arabian vACC Discord server.

!!! warning
    All documentation in this section is intended solely for use on the VATSIM network and must not be used for real-world aviation operations. The authors disclaim any liability for personal injury or death resulting from misuse of this material.

## Grading Criteria
Controllers will be graded during each session with a mentor or instructor. These evaluations are designed using Competency-Based Training and Assessment (CBTA) principles to ensure that controllers are progressing in both skills and knowledge.

The specific grading methods and criteria is defined in the Arabian vACC Training Policy.

## Theoretical Course
The following list outlines the theoretical topics covered in the C1 Rating course available on the Moodle platform.

### Aerodrome SOP
Specific SOP for all aerodromes within the student's designated training FIR.

### Terminal Area SOP
Specific SOP for all terminal areas within the student's designated training FIR.

### Enroute SOP
Specific SOP for enroute procedures for the student's designated training FIR.

## Learning Objectives
### Altimetry
Students should be able to define the following terms:  

- Transition Altitude  
- Transition Level  
- Minimum Holding Altitude/Level  

Students should also be able to provide the minimum stack level for aerodromes or CTAs/TMAs under their control.  

### Appreciation of Aircraft Performance
Students demonstrate awareness of aircraft performance by:  

- Issuing descent instructions at appropriate times  
- Applying speeds suitable to the descent profile being flown  

### Climbs & Descents with Respect to Local Airspace
Students ensure that aircraft remain within controlled airspace and within their sector. They must not issue instructions that risk aircraft leaving controlled or assigned airspace.  

### Contacting Aircraft from Uncontrolled Airspace
Students must contact aircraft before they enter their sector.  

- Aircraft sent a *contact me* are assumed by the student, ensuring adjacent controllers are aware of who is responsible for the aircraft.  

### Coordination with Approach Units
All coordination with approach units must be performed when appropriate, in a manner that is **clear, concise, and timely**.  

### Coordination with Enroute Units
Examples of enroute coordination include:  

- Releases  
- Non-standard flights  
- Coordinating a higher level when handoff is delayed  
- Coordinating shortcuts  

Where verbal coordination is inappropriate, students must use their controller client’s built-in coordination functionality.  

### Efficiency
Students maximize efficiency by:  

- Keeping aircraft climbing or descending wherever possible  
- Minimizing extended periods of level flight  

### Ensuring Separation
Students consistently ensure separation. Key principles include:  

- Confirming that headings or speeds are effective before removing vertical separation  
- Immediately correcting unsafe instructions  
- Responding confidently and with justification if challenged regarding a potential loss of separation  

### Enroute Holding
Students should be able to describe any published enroute hold.  

### Flight Information Service (FIS)
Students must understand the role and provision of **Flight Information Service**, and be able to explain:  

- Applicable flight rules (VFR/IFR)  
- Surveillance vs. non-surveillance environments  
- Terrain clearance responsibilities  
- Ability to provide vectors and levels for sequencing  

### Issuing of STARs
Students must reassign a STAR when a pilot has filed one that is inappropriate for their flight.  

### Pace and Clarity
Students transmit at a consistent pace and plan their instructions before transmitting. They make effective use of alias files to ensure prompt and efficient communication.  

### Presentation of Aircraft into Holding Facilities
Students present aircraft to approach units safely, maintaining a suitable distance between them (no less than 6 NM unless specific agreements state otherwise).  

### Presentation of Traffic
Students must understand the requirements of the next controller and position aircraft optimally for onward travel.  

Examples include:  

- Positioning aircraft in parallel streams for later turns  
- Initiating headings to prepare aircraft for the beginning of a parallel stream  

### Prioritisation of Traffic
Students recognize and act upon time-critical instructions, such as establishing aircraft on the localiser during top-down service.  
They also make use of *“when ready”* clearances during non-critical periods to reduce future workload.  

### Proactivity
Students anticipate potential conflicts well in advance and take proactive measures to resolve them quickly.  

Examples of measures include:  

- Using headings to reduce separation  
- Issuing direct routings to avoid conflicts  

Conflicts are broadly defined as any situation where an aircraft is prevented from achieving its objective (e.g., reaching a climb target) due to other traffic.  

### Professionalism and Attitude
Students remain calm, courteous, and professional at all times, even when pilots or adjacent controllers make mistakes.  

### Provision of Top-down Control
Students demonstrate the ability to reduce top-down control, in line with GRP, in order to manage high workload effectively.  

### Radar Identification
Students must understand identification principles and limitations:  

- **Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR):** Identification via radar returns.  
- **Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) / Multilateration (MLAT):** Identification via transponder replies.  
- **Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast (ADS-B):** Identification via ADS-B data.  

Automated ATS systems indicate the sensor type(s) in use (PSR, SSR/MLAT, ADS-B, or combined). Students must:  
- Select appropriate identification methods  
- Recognize the limitations of each method  
- Switch methods if the chosen one is unsatisfactory  

**Validation:**  
- Understand validation procedures and when squawks are considered validated  
- Recognize conspicuous codes (e.g., 2000, 7000) and avoid using them for identification  
- Explain the role of conspicuous and listening squawks  

**Verification:**  
- Use Mode C for vertical verification  
- Verify the level of pilots new to approach control on first contact  
- Require altitude/level reports when not provided  
- Provide local QNH if below the transition level  

### Releases
Students must understand the following types of releases:  

- Full release  
- Turn release  
- Climb/descent release  

### Standing Agreements
Students must know the agreed levels relevant to their sectors and demonstrate an understanding of uncommon standing agreements.  

Examples of uncommon agreements include:  

- Those rarely used  
- Agreements that vary with the situation (e.g., cruise-level specifics into Doha)  
- Multi-component agreements (e.g., headings to a specific fix or airways clearances requiring additional conditions)  

### Standard Routings
Students must know the SIDs and STARs relevant to their sector, including any associated restrictions.  

### Use of Datablocks
Students are encouraged to use scratchpads and datablock functions to enhance situational awareness.  

If a student elects not to use certain datablock aspects, they must be able to explain the conventions and provide a valid reason. Students must: 

- Use heading, altitude, and speed blocks  
- Keep datablocks updated promptly  
- Follow standard conventions when using soft speeds  

### Use of Enroute Holding
Students manage aircraft in the stack effectively by:  

- Promptly descending aircraft to minimize gaps  
- Demonstrating awareness of the next controller’s workload  
- Presenting aircraft in good time and at appropriate levels  

### Use of Speed Control
Students apply speed control appropriately by:  

- Reducing speed in sufficient time before a holding facility  
- Cancelling speed restrictions promptly when no longer required  

### Use of Standard Radiotelephony
Students issue instructions using standard RT. Communications must be:  

- Unambiguous  
- Decisive  

### Use of Vectors for Sequencing and Reduced Separation
Students demonstrate sequencing techniques such as parallel streaming, ensuring horizontal separation before removing vertical separation.
