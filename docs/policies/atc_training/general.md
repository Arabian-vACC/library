# 1. Scope
Welcome to the Arabian vACC ATC Training Policy. This document serves as a comprehensive guide for all aspiring and current controllers within the vACC. Whether you are just beginning your journey as a Student Controller or progressing toward Center positions, this policy will outline the expectations, procedures, and pathways that support your growth and success within the network.

Our training spans three key FIRs across the Middle East: Doha (OTDF), Muscat (OOMM), and the United Arab Emirates (OMAE). Through consistent standards, region-specific procedures, and a focus on real-world accuracy, we aim to deliver a high-quality experience that mirrors real ATC operations while being accessible to all levels of experience.

Our approach balances theory and practice, with a progression system designed to build your skills one rating at a time. This policy will guide you through that journey — from initial onboarding to rating advancement, endorsement acquisition, and beyond.

!!! warning
    All documentation in this section is intended solely for use on the VATSIM network and must not be used for real-world aviation operations. The authors disclaim any liability for personal injury or death resulting from misuse of this material.

# 2. Foundations for ATC Students
## 2.1 Software
The following software is essential for beginning your ATC training. Each of these tools will be required not only during your initial training but also throughout your entire ATC journey once you obtain your first rating.

### 2.1.1 Controller Client
Euroscope is the primary radar client used for controlling within the Arabian vACC. It can be downloaded from the [Euroscope website](https://www.euroscope.hu/wp/). All Arabian vACC sector files are specifically designed to work with Euroscope only.

The ATC Operations Department releases updated sector files every AIRAC cycle to ensure controllers have the latest navigation data and any changes relevant to the FIRs. These files are built to closely replicate real-world ATM systems and operational layouts.

Sector files for each FIR can be downloaded from the [AeroNav GNG website](https://files.aero-nav.com/), with direct links to each FIR below:

- [Doha FIR (OTDF)](https://files.aero-nav.com/OTDF)
- [Muscat FIR (OOMM)](https://files.aero-nav.com/OOMM)
- [Emirates FIR (OMAE)](https://files.aero-nav.com/OMAE)

A detailed setup guide for installing Euroscope and the Arabian vACC sector files is available under the "Controller Software Setup" section of the [Arabian vACC Library](https://library.arabian-vacc.com/foundations/).

### 2.2.2 Audio Client(s)
To communicate with pilots while controlling on the network, you must install an approved Audio for VATSIM client. Supported options include [Audio for VATSIM](https://audio.vatsim.net/docs/atc/euroscope) and [TrackAudio](https://github.com/pierr3/TrackAudio/releases/tag/1.3.1).

A step-by-step setup guide for these audio clients can be found in the "Controller Software Setup" section of the [Arabian vACC Library](https://library.arabian-vacc.com/foundations/).

### 2.2.3 vATIS Client
To provide pilots with up-to-date aerodrome operational information, you will need the [vATIS Client](https://vatis.app/).

A detailed setup guide for vATIS is available in the "Controller Software Setup" section of the [Arabian vACC Library](https://library.arabian-vacc.com/foundations/).

### 2.2.4 Discord
Discord serves as the primary communication platform for the Arabian vACC and is used for a range of purposes, including:

- Announcements to the entire vACC  
- Event marketing and rostering  
- Coordination between ATC controllers  
- Communication and collaboration between students, mentors, and instructors within the ATC Training Program

# 3. The Waiting List
Before a controller can be offered a place in a training plan, they must first express their interest and be added to the waiting list.

After completing all prerequisites outlined in the Training Plan section, the controller must submit a support ticket through the Arabian vACC Discord to confirm their eligibility.

Controllers will only be enrolled into a training plan once all requirements have been fully met. 

Please note: Observers should refer to the S1 Training section of this policy for specific guidance.

## 3.1 Maintaining Your Spot on the Waiting List
To remain on the waiting list, controllers must:

- Stay active on the Arabian vACC ATC roster
- Maintain residency within the Arabian vACC

Controllers who do not meet these conditions will be removed from the waiting list.

## 3.2 Losing Your Spot on the Waiting List
The Arabian vACC ATC Training Department reserves the right to remove a controller from the waiting list without prior notice in circumstances including, but not limited to:

- Disciplinary action taken against the controller  
- Repeated negative feedback received while controlling positions associated with their current rating

## 3.3 Controller Activity
According to the Arabian vACC Membership Policy, controllers must log a minimum of **6 hours of ATC activity per calendar quarter** to remain active on the controller roster. 

Failure to meet this requirement will result in **automatic removal** from the roster and **any associated training plan or waiting list**.

The calendar quarters are defined as follows:

- **Quarter 1 (Q1) - 1st January to 31st March**
- **Quarter 2 (Q2) - 1st April to 30th June**
- **Quarter 3 (Q3) - 1st July to 30th September**
- **Quarter 4 (Q4) - 1st October to 31st December**

# 4. Training Plan
## 4.1 Eligibility
To be eligible for enrollment in a training plan on Hayya, students must meet the following criteria:

- Be a **resident of the Arabian vACC** and in **good standing**.
- Have successfully completed the **relevant divisional rating exam**.

Controllers seeking to progress beyond the S1 rating must also:

- Be **active on the Arabian vACC Controller Roster**.
- Have accumulated a **minimum of 50 hours** controlling under their current rating.
- Have **no significant negative feedback** on record.

Members are not permitted to reject their assigned training aerodrome, terminal sector, or enroute sector in the expectation of receiving an alternative offer for a preferred position.

Members on the waiting list may be offered a training plan for a specific aerodrome or sector. If the member declines the offer, they may be **removed from the waiting list** at the discretion of the ATC Training Department.

This policy ensures fair and efficient use of training resources and minimizes delays for all members in the training pipeline.

## 4.2 Training Facilities Across Arabian vACC FIRs
Training may be conducted within any of the Arabian vACC's three FIRs, with the exception of Tier 1 positions. The available training facilities are as follows:

- **Aerodrome (S1/S2)**
    - Doha-Hamad International Airport (OTHH)
    - Muscat International Airport (OOMS)
    - Sharjah International Airport (OMSJ)
    - Sheikh Zayed International Airport (OMAA)

- **Terminal (S3)**
    - Abu Dhabi CTA (OMAA/OMAD/OMAL)
    - Doha TMA (OTHH/OTBD)
    - Muscat TMA (OOMS)

- **Enroute (C1)**
    - Doha FIR (OTDF)
    - Muscat FIR (OOMS)
    - Emirates FIR (OMAE)  
      - *Note: Controllers seeking Enroute training within the Emirates FIR must possess all Tier 1 endorsements. In the absence of these endorsements, if the member still wishes to do training in the Emirates FIR, training will be limited to the UAE South Sector, which excludes the Dubai CTA.*

## 4.3 Training Engagement and Availability Expectations
ATC training within the Arabian vACC is a rigorous process. Given the high number of students and the limited number of available mentors and instructors, training resources must be used efficiently. To support this, members enrolled in a training plan are expected to demonstrate consistent engagement and flexibility.

### 4.3.1 Availability Requirements
- **Maintaining Availability**: Students must keep their availability in Hayya up-to-date at all times while holding a position within a training plan.
- **Active Session Requests**: An active session request in Hayya is required at all times. This allows mentors and instructors to identify and accept training opportunities efficiently.
- **Diverse Availability**: Students should aim to provide a wide range of availability—including daytime, evenings, and weekends—where possible. As mentors and instructors may be located in different time zones, flexibility significantly increases the likelihood of receiving training sessions.
- **Session Cancellations**: If a student needs to cancel a scheduled session or withdraw a session request, they must either remove their availability in Hayya or notify their mentor or instructor directly.

#### 4.3.2 Leave of Absence
If a student is unable to participate in training for an extended period while enrolled in a training plan, they must notify the Arabian vACC ATC Training Department by submitting a support ticket via the Arabian vACC Discord server. Requests for a break will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The department will make every effort to accommodate personal circumstances, but clear communication is essential.

#### 4.3.4 Volunteer Availability and Expectations
Mentors and instructors are volunteers who generously offer their time. While the department aims to provide each student with approximately 2–3 hours of training per week, this is not always possible. All training staff—including department members, instructors, and mentors—volunteer on an ad hoc basis, and availability may vary from week to week. As such, the frequency of training sessions cannot be guaranteed.

#### 4.3.5 Recommendations to Improve Training Opportunities
To increase the likelihood of receiving training sessions, students are strongly encouraged to:

- Enter as much availability as possible for the upcoming **14 days**
- Provide availability in **blocks of at least 90 minutes**, with longer periods preferred

## 4.4 Training Plan Removal
To ensure fairness to all students awaiting entry into a training plan, spots may be forfeited for reasons under the following conditions:

- The member becomes **inactive on the Arabian vACC roster**.
- The member **fails to maintain availability or submit a session request in Hayya within one week** of receiving a reminder.
- The member **fails to maintain availability or submit a session request after receiving three consecutive reminders**.
- The member **fails to attend three scheduled mentoring sessions** without prior notice (“no-shows”).

#### 4.4.1 Discretionary Removal
The ATC Training Department Director reserves the right to remove a member from a training plan at their discretion in circumstances including, but not limited to:

- **Consistent lack of progress** compared to expected training milestones.
- **Lack of engagement** with the training course or communication with training staff.
- **Disciplinary action** taken against the member.
- **Repeated negative feedback** while controlling positions the member is already rated for.

All forfeiture decisions will be made in alignment with the broader goals of maintaining fairness, efficiency, and high standards across the training program.

# 5. Self-Study
Students are expected to engage with the theoretical content provided in the [Arabian vACC Library](https://library.arabian-vacc.com) outside of their scheduled mentoring sessions. This includes, but is not limited to, reviewing assigned readings, practicing relevant skills, and deepening their understanding of core concepts. Mentors and instructors may also suggest additional resources or encourage observation of experienced controllers.

After each mentoring session, mentors and instructors will provide comprehensive feedback. It is the student's responsibility to carefully review these reports and address any areas highlighted by the mentor for improvement. This may involve independent study on certain topics or revisiting specific techniques. Research consistently shows that students who actively engage with feedback and make necessary adjustments tend to progress more rapidly through training and perform better on exams.

Arriving unprepared for a session, whether through a lack of review of session reports or theoretical material, is considered unprofessional. Mentors and instructors are within their rights to end a session prematurely if they feel that the student has not made adequate efforts to prepare. In such cases, a report will be submitted to the ATC Training Department Director for further review. This may lead to the student's removal from the training plan if insufficient progress or engagement is noted.

# 6. Asking for Help
In aviation, there are no "stupid" questions—it's always better to ask than to remain silent. The ATC Training Department staff, instructors, and mentors are always available and happy to assist students with any questions related to their training. Students are encouraged to direct their questions to the #training-text channel on the Arabian vACC Discord.

# 7. Attending a Mentoring Session
Mentoring sessions will be conducted via the [Arabian vACC Discord Server](https://community.vatsim.net/), which offers the ability to use screen-sharing when necessary. Students should join the waiting room promptly, fully prepared with their controlling software configured and any necessary resources at hand, ready to begin the session as soon as their mentor or instructor moves them into the training room.

!!! info
    Due to local regulations in the U.A.E, where VOIP services like Discord are blocked, students residing in the U.A.E will not be able to conduct their sessions through Discord. In such cases, an alternative communication platform may be used, subject to agreement between the student and their mentor or instructor. While it is possible to use a VPN to bypass these restrictions, the Arabian vACC does not support or endorse the use of VPNs.

# 8. Solo Validations
In accordance with the Middle East & North Africa Division ATC Training Policy, the Arabian vACC is responsible for issuing solo validations for students working toward their tower, approach, and center ratings. The responsibility for these validations lies with the assigned mentor or instructor. The following solo validations may be granted:

| Solo Validation | Details |
|-----------------|---------|
| **Tower** | - Available to Arabian vACC residents training for S2.<br>- Granted for the position where the student's training has taken place.<br>- Valid for up to 90 days. |
| **Approach** | - Available to Arabian vACC residents training for S3.<br>- Granted for the position where the student's training has taken place.<br>- Valid for up to 90 days. |
| **Center** | - Available to Arabian vACC residents training for C1.<br>- Granted for the position where the student's training has taken place.<br>- Valid for up to 90 days. |


Solo validations will only be granted for a maximum of 30 days at a time before a practical exam is required. If a student does not pass the exam, they may continue to operate under a solo validation after receiving additional mentoring sessions. Students holding a solo validation are authorized to control at any time on their assigned training position, including during events, without the presence of a mentor.

# 9. Examinations
## 9.1 Theoretical
All theoretical modules and exams for the S1, S2, S3, and C1 ratings are available through the [Middle East & North Africa Academy](https://academy.vatsim.me). Completion of these modules and exams is required to be eligible for enrollment in a training plan.

## 9.2 Practical
When a student, in agreement with their mentor or instructor, feels ready, they can submit a request for an examination through the ATC Training Department. Before being forwarded for a practical exam, students will be consulted to ensure they are fully prepared, and additional training can be arranged if requested by the student. 

For S2 exams, there will be one local examiner present. S3 and C1 exams will have both a divisional examiner and a local examiner in attendance.

All exams are open-book. Students are encouraged to use any available resources to assist in answering questions. Examiners prefer that students know where to find information rather than guess. However, students are prohibited from soliciting answers from others on the network. Any attempt to do so will result in an automatic failure of the exam.

Exams typically last no more than 90 minutes, followed by a debrief with the examiners to ensure the exam process is concluded.

The possible outcomes of the exam are as follows:

- Pass
- Incomplete (to be continued at a later date)
- Fail

An exam will not be marked as a pass if:

- Any competency is marked as fail or not assessed.
- Three or more competencies are marked as inadequate.

If the student passes the exam, the result will be posted on the Arabian vACC Discord, and the rating will be issued within 48 hours after the exam report has been submitted. If the exam is marked as incomplete, the request will be retained, and the exam will be continued with either the same or different examiners at a later date. 

In the event of a failure, the examiners will conduct a thorough debrief and create a remedial training plan, which will be forwarded to the student's mentor or instructor.

# 10 Fast-Track Program
In accordance with the Middle East & North Africa Division ATC Training Policy, the Arabian vACC offers a fast-track program for members who hold real-world ATC licenses or wish to transfer their rating from IVAO. To begin this process, members must submit a support ticket on the Arabian vACC Discord server, providing proof of their real-world license (with any sensitive information redacted as necessary) or their IVAO profile.

All members participating in the fast-track program are still required to complete the relevant theoretical exams for the rating they are pursuing. Upon successfully passing these exams, they will proceed with the standard mentoring sessions before being issued their rating.

## 10.1 Real-World Licenses
| Real-World License Fast Track                | Rating |
|----------------------------------------------|--------|
| Frozen ATPL, ATPL, MPL, and Real-World ATCO up to TWR | S2     |
| All Real-World ATCO                          | S3     |


## 10.2 IVAO Rating Transfer
| IVAO Fast Track      | Rating              |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| ADC and Below       | No Fast Track Possible |
| APC                 | S2                  |
| ACC and Above       | S3                  |


# 11. Grading Criteria
Controllers will be graded during each session with a mentor or instructor based on the relevant syllabus for their current rating or endorsement. These evaluations are designed using Competency-Based Training and Assessment (CBTA) principles to ensure that controllers are progressing in both skills and knowledge.

## 11.1 Performance Levels
Controllers will be assessed according to specific core **competencies** and will have **performance** graded for each competency in each session. The following performance levels exist:

- **Below:** The controller's performance is below the expected standard for their current rating or endorsement.
- **At:** The controller meets the expected standard for their rating or endorsement.
- **Above:** The controller exceeds the expected standard for their rating or endorsement.

Controllers should aim to be **"At"** the expected performance level as they progress through their training, after which they will be deemed **"Competent"**. If a controller is rated **"Below"**, the controller is deemed **Not Yet Competent**, additional sessions will be required to address and correct the issues identified during training.

## 11.2 Input Required from the Mentor or Instructor
In addition to performance evaluation, controllers will be assessed based on the level of input required from the mentor or instructor during the session. This helps identify the controller's ability to operate independently and effectively. The following input levels are used:

- **Constant:** The controller requires frequent reminders throughout the session, indicating a need for further development.
- **Intermittent:** The controller needs occasional reminders, showing progress but still requiring guidance.
- **Minor:** The controller requires no or very few reminders, indicating good progress and near independence.
- **N/A:** The specific was not covered or did not apply during this session.

Controllers should strive for **"Minor"** where no input is required from the mentor or instructor. If a controller is rated as **"Constant,"** additional sessions will be necessary to address gaps in their knowledge or performance.

This grading system helps ensure that controllers receive the support and training they need to meet the required standards for their ratings and endorsements. Continuous feedback and targeted training sessions are crucial for controllers to advance to higher levels of proficiency.

# 12. ATC Training

!!! info
    **Note:** A valid **Dubai TMA** endorsement is required to undertake training or operations on the U.A.E Radar position when using the bandbox sector in a top-down configuration.

### 12.4.2 Syllabus & Training Program
The syllabus and training content for the C1 rating, as delivered by mentors and instructors, is available through the Arabian vACC Library.

## 12.5 C3
The Senior Controller (C3) rating may be awarded to a controller already certified to provide the six (6) standard VATSIM controller services (DEL, GND, TWR, APP, DEP, CTR) and who also provides services beyond those roles. The C3 rating is intended to recognize seniority, performance, or involvement in roles beyond standard control duties, as determined by the local Region or Division.

The Controller Practical Test (CPT) for the C3 rating will assess:

- Ability to service multiple airports or positions.
- Ability to handle IFR and VFR traffic sharing the same airspace.
- Ability to respond to abnormal situations.
- Maintaining a steady and organized traffic flow.
- Strong traffic awareness.
- Maintaining situational awareness (“The Big Picture”).
- Coordination with adjacent controllers.
- Use of correct and professional English phraseology.

Further information is available in the VATMENA Controller Practical Examination Policy.

## 12.6 Additional Endorsements
### 12.6.1 Dubai
All positions within Dubai are designated as Tier 1 under the GCAP policy. As such, controllers of all ratings must obtain a Tier 1 endorsement before they are authorized to control any Dubai positions.

It is important to note that the airports of Al-Maktoum (OMDW) and Sharjah (OMSJ) are not classified as Tier 1 and do not require a Tier 1 endorsement to control.

| Dubai-Specific Endorsements | Eligibility                         |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Dubai DEL/GND**           | For controllers holding an S1 rating |
| **Dubai TWR**               | For controllers holding an S2 rating |
| **Dubai TMA**               | For controllers holding an S3 rating | 

Please note: The **Dubai TMA** endorsement is also required to conduct training or operations on the U.A.E Radar position when using the bandbox sector in a top-down capacity.

#### 12.6.2 Eligibility
Before a controller is eligible to complete a Tier 1 Dubai endorsement, they must meet the following requirements:

- Be **active on the Arabian vACC Controller Roster**  
- Have **no significant negative feedback** on record

Additional requirements based on the endorsement being pursued:

- **Dubai DEL/GND** – Minimum of 25 hours on the S1 rating  
- **Dubai TWR** – Minimum of 25 hours on the S2 rating  
- **Dubai TMA** – Minimum of 35 hours on the S3 rating  

Controllers who meet all the requirements above must submit a support ticket to the Arabian vACC ATC Training Department to express their interest in obtaining the Tier 1 Dubai endorsement. 

If a controller applies for a DEL/GND endorsement and later obtains their S2 rating, they will need to go through the same process again to obtain the next Tier 1 Dubai endorsement for TWR. Similarly, controllers holding an S3 rating and seeking the Tier 1 Dubai endorsement for TMA will need to follow the same process.

### 12.6.3 Theoretical Course & Examination
The theoretical course for the specific Tier 1 Dubai endorsement is available through the [Arabian vACC Moodle](https://moodle.arabian-vacc.com/) platform. This course includes all relevant resources required to understand and operate the Dubai positions effectively.

Access to the theoretical course will only be granted once the controller has met all eligibility criteria outlined above and has formally requested access. Access to the theoretical exam will be granted a week after being enrolled on the relevant Dubai Moodle course.

Upon successful completion of the theoretical examination, the controller must submit a support ticket to the Arabian vACC ATC Training Department confirming they have passed and completed the theoretical examination. Once the department has verified the result, the controller will be eligible to proceed to the practical phase. 

### 12.6.4 Practical Training
Controllers who have passed the specific Tier 1 Dubai theoretical examination will then be able to proceed to the practical phase and undergo sessions with a mentor or instructor. These sessions will cover the practical aspects of the training, applying all theoretical knowledge to ensure the controller understands the procedures and operations of the position. The conduct of these sessions is outlined below.

### 12.6.5 Tier 1 Ground
Practical training will be as follows:

- One sweatbox familiarisation session
- One practical assessment session online on the network where the student is graded on an assessment scoresheet

At the discretion of the mentor or instructor, the student may be granted an additional session before the assessment.

### 12.6.6 Tier 1 Tower
Practical training will be as follows:

- Two sweatbox familiarisation sessions
- One online familiarisation session
- One practical assessment session online on the network where the student is graded on an assessment scoresheet

### 12.6.7 Tier 1 Terminal Area
Practical training will be as follows:

- Two sweatbox familiarisation sessions
- One familiarisation session on the live network or sweatbox at the discretion of the mentor or instructor
- One online familiarisation session
- One practical assessment session online on the network where the student is graded on an assessment scoresheet

### 12.6.8 Granting of Tier 1 Approvals
After successfully completing the practical phase and once a mentor or instructor is satisfied with the controller's performance such that the student is deemed "Competent", the endorsement will be added to the controller's profile on Hayya.

At any point, if the controller fails to meet the required level of competency during the practical assessment, they will be deemed "Not Yet Competent" and they must reapply for Tier 1 approvals **after a minimum of 30 days from the day of the assessment**.

Controllers are not permitted to connect on any Dubai positions until the endorsement is visible on the controller roster on Hayya.

## 12.7 AFIS
All Aerodrome Flight Information Service (AFIS) positions within the Arabian vACC, located in the Doha (OTDF), Muscat (OOMM), and U.A.E (OMAE) FIRs, are classified as Tier 2 positions under the GCAP policy.

As a result, controllers must obtain a specific Tier 2 endorsement before being authorized to control any AFIS position within these FIRs. This endorsement ensures that the controller has demonstrated the required knowledge and competence to operate safely and effectively in an AFIS environment.

### 12.7.1 Eligibility
Before a controller is eligible to complete a Tier 2 AFIS endorsement, they must meet the following requirements:

- Be **active on the Arabian vACC Controller Roster**.
- Have accumulated a **minimum of 50 hours** controlling under their S2 rating.
- Have **no significant negative feedback** on record.

If controllers have met all the requirements listed above, they must submit a support ticket to the Arabian vACC ATC Training Department to express their interest in obtaining the AFIS endorsement. 

### 12.7.2 Theoretical Course & Examination
The theoretical course for AFIS operations is available through the [Arabian vACC Moodle](https://moodle.arabian-vacc.com/) platform. This course includes all relevant resources required to understand and operate AFIS positions effectively.

Access to the theoretical examination will only be granted once the controller has met all eligibility criteria outlined above and has formally requested access.

Upon successful completion of the theoretical examination, the controller must submit a support ticket to the Arabian vACC ATC Training Department confirming they have passed and completed the theoretical examination. Once the department has verified the result, the AFIS endorsement will be added to the controller's profile.

Controllers are not permitted to connect on any AFIS positions until the endorsement is visible on the controller roster on Hayya.

## 12.8 Military
All military positions within the Arabian vACC, located in the Doha (OTDF), Muscat (OOMM), and U.A.E (OMAE) FIRs, are classified as Tier 2 positions under the GCAP policy.

As such, controllers must obtain a dedicated Tier 2 military endorsement before they are authorized to control any military position within these FIRs. This endorsement confirms that the controller has demonstrated the necessary knowledge and operational competence to manage military traffic in accordance with established procedures and standards.

The following military-specific endorsements are available:

- **Military TWR** – For controllers holding an S2 rating  
- **Military APP** – For controllers holding an S3 rating  
- **Military CTR** – For controllers holding a C1 rating  

### 12.8.1 Eligibility
Before a controller is eligible to complete a Tier 2 military endorsement, they must meet the following requirements:

- Be **active on the Arabian vACC Controller Roster**  
- Have **no significant negative feedback** on record

Additional requirements based on the endorsement being pursued:

- **Military TWR** – Minimum of 50 hours on the S2 rating  
- **Military APP** – Minimum of 50 hours on the S2 rating  
- **Military CTR** – Minimum of 50 hours on the C1 rating  

If controllers have met all the requirements listed above, they must submit a support ticket to the Arabian vACC ATC Training Department to express their interest in obtaining the military endorsement. 

If a controller applies for a TWR endorsement and later obtains their S2 rating, they will need to go through the same process again to obtain the next Tier 2 military endorsement for APP. Similarly, controllers holding a C1 rating and seeking the Tier 2 military endorsement for CTR will need to follow the same process.

### 12.8.2 Theoretical Course & Examination
The theoretical course for military operations is available through the [Arabian vACC Moodle](https://moodle.arabian-vacc.com) platform. This course contains all essential materials required to understand and operate military positions effectively within the Arabian vACC.

Access to the theoretical examination will only be granted once the controller has met all eligibility criteria outlined above and has formally requested access.

Upon successful completion of the theoretical examination, the controller must submit a support ticket to the Arabian vACC ATC Training Department confirming they have passed the assessment. Once the department has verified the result, the military endorsement will be added to the controller's profile.

Controllers are not permitted to connect on any military positions until the endorsement is visible on their controller roster in Hayya.
