## Organization
The **Arabian Virtual Area Control Center** (hereinafter referred to as **Arabian vACC** or **ARBvACC**) is a recognized subdivision within the **Middle East & North Africa Division (VATMENA)**, operating under the **Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region (VATEMEA)** of the **VATSIM Network**.

The Arabian vACC is responsible for the provision, management, and facilitation of Air Traffic Control (ATC) services on the VATSIM network across the airspaces of **Oman**, **Qatar**, and the **United Arab Emirates**. These services are delivered in accordance with the vACC's guiding values of **#ClearVision** and **#ClearMission**, aiming to uphold a high standard of realism and operational excellence.

As part of its core responsibilities, the Arabian vACC oversees the training and certification of controllers operating within the **Muscat FIR (OOMM)**, **Doha FIR (OTDF)**, and **U.A.E FIR (OMAE)**.

All members of VATSIM are expected to comply with the **VATSIM Code of Conduct** and **Code of Regulations**, which serve as the foundational rules governing behavior and operations across the network.

# 1. Controller Membership
## 1.1 Transferring Controllers
A **transferring controller** is defined as a VATSIM member seeking a permanent reassignment from their current vACC to the Arabian vACC. The following conditions apply:

- The controller may hold **any ATC rating**.
- A **minimum of 50 hours of controlling** must be logged at the current vACC before applying.
- The controller must have completed any **rating upgrade or previous transfer at least 90 days prior** to the new transfer request.
- The controller must agree to and comply with the **Arabian vACC ATC Training Policy** upon acceptance.
- All transfers must conform to the **VATSIM Transfer and Visiting Controller Policy (TVCP)** and the **VATMENA Membership Policy**.

To initiate a transfer request, please refer to the official guide:

üëâ [**Joining the Arabian vACC**](https://library.arabian-vacc.com/getting_started/joining_arabian/)

This guide outlines the required steps and documentation for a successful transfer application.

## 1.2 Visting Controllers
A **visiting controller** is a VATSIM member who retains their primary home vACC but wishes to control within the Arabian vACC on an occasional basis. Visiting controllers must meet the following criteria:

- Applicants must possess an **S2 ATC rating for VATMENA residents** or an **S3 ATC rating for non-VATMENA residents**, in compliance with the **VATSIM Global Controller Administration Policy (GCAP)** and **VATSIM Transfer Visiting Controller Policy (TVCP)**.
- Must comply with the **Arabian vACC Training Policy** and **operational procedures**.
- Acceptance is subject to staff discretion and space availability.

To apply as a visitor, please consult the official visiting controller guide:

üëâ [**Applying as a Visiting Controller**](https://library.arabian-vacc.com/getting_started/starting_atc_training/)

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for submitting your application and preparing for operations within the Arabian vACC.

## 1.3 VATMENA Transfer and Visiting Policy Alignment
The Arabian vACC abides by Sections **7, 8, and 9** of the **VATMENA Membership Policy** regarding all inbound transfer and visiting controller requests. Please note:

- **Transfer controllers** are not considered full division members until all onboarding and training requirements have been met.
- **Visiting controllers** will not be added to the Arabian vACC ATC roster until all initial approvals and training prerequisites are fulfilled.

# 2. Controller Activity Requirements
## 2.1 Maintaining currency

To maintain a high level of operational readiness and service, all controllers assigned to the Arabian vACC are required to meet the following **minimum quarterly activity** threshold:

| Category     | Hours Requirement                                  | Notes                                          |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Unrestricted | Minimum of 3 hours per quarter in highest approved position  | Hours do not count towards Tier 1 hour requirement |
| Tier 1       | Minimum of 3 hours per quarter in highest approved position | Hours count towards unrestricted total          |


* **Hours controlled on a Tier 2 facility only count towards restricted hours, and as such do not count for the Tier 1 requirement.**

* **Sessions below 30 minutes are also not counted towards your monthly requirement, as per the operations policy.**

Calendar quarter are those as defined in the Arabian vACC Membership Policy, clause 7.

This activity requirement supports the Arabian vACC's core values of **#ClearVision** and **#ClearMission**, ensuring service consistency and procedural compliance with [GCAP policy 9.4(c)(i)](https://cdn.vatsim.net/policy-documents/GCAP_v1.1_Release.pdf) and divisional policy [VATMENA_POL_TRP_R01-2025](https://cdn.vatsim.me/policies/VATMENA_POL_TRP_R01-2025.pdf).

## 2.2 Non-Compliance and Roster Removals
Controllers who fail to meet the quarterly activity requirement will be:

- Removed from the Arabian vACC roster;
- Have all **endorsements and position approvals revoked**.

**Roster cleanups** are conducted on the final day of March, June, September, and December. A general notice will be issued on the Arabian vACC Discord server 2 to 4 weeks in advance.
## 2.3 Leave of Absence (LoA)
Controllers may request a **Leave of Absence (LoA)** if unable to meet activity requirements. The following conditions apply:

| Step / Topic            | Details                                                                                      |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Submission             | Submit a support ticket via the Arabian vACC Discord, titled **"Leave of Absence Request"**  |
| Reason                 | Provide a valid reason for the request. Approval is subject to staff discretion.             |
| Duration               | LoA duration: up to 90 days, with one renewal allowed unless extended by written approval from the Membership Director or designee. |
| Activity Requirement   | Controllers on LoA are exempt from the activity requirement and will be marked as ‚ÄúNot Approved‚Äù on the roster. |
| Revocation             | If a controller is found actively controlling on the network during their LoA, the leave will be immediately revoked. |


Controllers may **cancel or modify** their LoA by notifying the Membership Department. Upon completion, the controller will return to their previously approved status. A **recurrency session** may be required if the LoA was extended.

# 3. Reinstatement to Roster

Once accepted for reinstatement, they shall follow the process as defined in the Arabian vACC Training Policy "Reinstatement to Roster" section.

## 3.2 Visiting Controllers
Visiting controllers removed from the roster for inactivity or other reasons (such as disciplinary or failure to meet competency requirements) may **reapply after a minimum of 30 days**.

* Compliance with Policies and Procedures
Controllers must comply with all applicable Arabian vACC standards, policies, and procedures, including:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>The Arabian vACC Training System</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>Operational Changes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Letters of Agreement (LoAs)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## 4.1 Zero Tolerance for Misconduct
Hate speech, violence, derogatory remarks, or personal attacks directed at pilots or fellow controllers will result in **immediate and permanent removal** from the Arabian vACC, with further reporting to the VATSIM network.

### Failure to comply with the conduct guidelines may lead to disciplinary action, including removal of controlling privileges.

# 5. Disputes and Reporting

## 5.1 Reporting Issues

Controllers can report non-compliance via [this form](https://vats.im/arb/feedback).

## 5.2 Conflict Resolution Process
If the feedback form does not sufficiently address the issue, controllers should first contact the vACC Membership Director by submitting a membership ticket. The ticket should follow the format below:

|Item              | Description                                         |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Conflict With     | [Name and CID of the individual involved]             |
| Describe Conflict | [Brief summary of the issue]                         |
| Evidence          | [Relevant screenshots, logs, or supporting documentation] |

If the issue remains unresolved after this step, it should be referred to the vACC Director or Deputy Director for informal mediation. Should the matter still not be resolved, it may be escalated to the Division Director or the Division Conflict Resolution Manager (DCRM) for further action.

# 6. Events
### Membership works directly with Marketing to ensure compliance with all relevant policies and to identify opportunities for improving event controller quality and attendance:

## 6.1 Cancellations and No-Shows
All cancellations and no-shows for events are recorded. Controllers should only sign up for an event if they can commit to attending. In unavoidable circumstances, controllers must notify the Marketing Department as soon as possible using both of the methods below:
* **Notify the person responsible for rostering**
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Post in the signup forum on Discord</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Submit a Support Ticket to the Marketing Department</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
