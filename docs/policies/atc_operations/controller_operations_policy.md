# 1. Scope

The **Arabian Virtual Area Control Center** (hereinafter referred to as **Arabian vACC** or **ARBvACC**) is a recognized subdivision within the **Middle East & North Africa Division (VATMENA)**, operating under the **Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region (VATEMEA)** of the **VATSIM Network**.

The Arabian vACC is responsible for providing, managing, and facilitating Air Traffic Control (ATC) services on the VATSIM network across the airspaces of **Oman**, **Qatar**, and the **United Arab Emirates**. These services are provided in accordance with the vACC's guiding values of **#ClearVision** and **#ClearMission**, aiming to maintain a high standard of realism and operational excellence.

The Arabian vACC oversees air traffic controller operations in the **Muscat FIR (OOMM)**, **Doha FIR (OTDF)**, and **U.A.E FIR (OMAE)**.

All VATSIM members are expected to comply with the **VATSIM Code of Conduct** and **Code of Regulations**, which govern behavior and operations across the network.

## 2. Training Standards

The Arabian vACC maintains a high standard of realism and excellence in ATC operations. 

- **Adherence to Official Procedures**  
  Controllers must follow the procedures outlined in:  
    - Arabian vMATS  
    - Published SOPs  
    - Operational Changes  
    - Letters of Agreement (LoAs)

- **Training Policy Compliance**  
  Controllers must adhere to:  
    - The Arabian vACC Training Process for Home and Visiting Controllers  
    - The Arabian vACC Activity Requirements Policy

Non-compliance may result in disciplinary action or restricted training and controlling privileges.

## 3. Spoken Language Requirement

- **English Proficiency**  
  English is the required language for all controller-pilot communication on VATSIM, in line with ICAO standards.

- **Use of Standard Phraseology**  
  Controllers must use ICAO-standard phraseology, as specified in the **Arabian Radiotelephony Manual**.

---

## 4. Controller Availability and Staffing

- **Full Staffing Requirement**  
  Controllers must remain at their position and actively monitor their station for the entire session.

- **Temporary Absences**  
  If a controller needs to step away for more than **5 minutes**, they must disconnect from the network. Reconnection should occur only when full control duties can resume.

- **Session Termination**  
  Controllers must follow the coordination procedure in the **"Ending a Session"** section before disconnecting.

---

## 5. Streaming While Controlling

- **Primary Duty**  
  Controllers who stream their sessions must **prioritize ATC duties** over stream interactions.

- **Consent and Notification**  
  Controllers intending to stream must:  
    - Notify fellow controllers in the **Discord coordination channel**  
    - Obtain consent from them before streaming in shared voice channels.

If consent is denied, the streaming controller must move to a separate Discord channel to avoid disrupting coordination.

---

## 6. Minimum Session Time

Controllers are required to meet the following session time requirements:

| Position | Minimum Session Time |
|:--------:|:--------------------:|
| DEL/GND |      30 Minutes      |

| DEP/APP |      30 Minutes      |
| CTR     |      30 Minutes      |

Sessions under 30 minutes will not be counted toward the controller's quarterly total. Repeated non-compliance may lead to disciplinary action.

---

## 7. Controller Bookings

### 7.1 General

The [Arabian vACC ATC Booking System (Coming Soon™)](https://arabian-vacc.com) allows rated Resident or Visitor controllers to book ATC positions within the vACC. Bookings are also submitted to the VATSIM ATC system.

### 7.2 Booking a Position

Controllers may only book positions they are authorized for or have received permission from an instructor/mentor to book ahead of a mentoring session.

### 7.3 ATC Booking Rules

Controllers must adhere to the following rules:

- An ATC booking does not grant the member control of the position.
- Controllers must comply with [VATSIM Code of Conduct: Section C5](https://vatsim.net/docs/policy/code-of-conduct).
- All members must respect each other's bookings.
- The ATC Training Departments bookings for online sessions take priority over normal controller bookings.
- Event bookings follow a different procedure and must not be made through this system. All event bookings take priority over anything else.
- Controllers should avoid repeatedly booking the same positions.

### 7.4 Controllers Not Showing Up for a Booked Position

Controllers must fulfill their bookings. If unable to attend, they must cancel their booking. Repeated no-shows may result in the revocation of booking privileges.

---

## 8. Controller Coordination

### 8.1 Commencing a Session

Controllers must complete coordination procedures before opening any position. They must check the Arabian vACC Discord server to see if adjacent controllers are present in coordination channels. If there is no adjacent controllers on discord then you **shall** follow the procedure below

``` mermaid
flowchart LR
   a[Controller checks out VATSIM Radar or equivalent to see if ATC is online] --> b[Adjacent controllers are online] --> c[Log on as an Observer] --> d[Coordinate with the next controller to determine ATIS, runways in use, and operational info] --> e[Log on desired position]
    a[Controller checks out VATSIM Radar or equivalent to see if ATC is online] --> f[Adjacent controllers are not online] --> e[Log on desired position]
```

---

## 9. Use of Relief Callsigns

Controllers relieving others during peak hours must use a relief callsign (e.g., `OMDB_R1_TWR`) to ensure proper transition and avoid disruption. You **should** change to the correct callsign as soon as possible.

---
## 10. Discord 

### 10.1 Discord presence

For coordination purposes, at times when two or more adjacent controllers are online within Arabian vACC, controllers **should** remain present on Discord, to allow for smoother coordination.
During events, controllers **must** remain present on Discord in relevant coordination channels, to allow for smoother coordination among adjacent controllers. Please see the Events Policy (section?) for more information

!!! info
    A future solution is in the works by the Operations Department, to allow a more optimised technical coordination solution. 

### 10.2  Discord Roles
Controllers may "subscribe" to specific roles on the Arabian vACC Discord server to receive notifications whenever those roles are used for the following purposes outlined below. Specific roles are used to ping controllers for important updates and changes. All controllers MUST stay up to date with the 📌│fir-updates fForum channel to ensure they always have the latest sector files and are up to date with the latest Library changes.

#### 10.3 ATC Support Requests
Controllers working top-down or handling excessive traffic may use this role to request support from lower-level controllers. This role is intended for situations where a controller is managing high-level traffic and requires assistance from a lower controller at a specific location. The role should be used in the discord channel 🚩│atc-marketplace and repeated incorrect use of this request may result in the revocation of the ability to use the role.

For example, a controller managing Dubai Arrivals while also handling traffic on the ground at multiple airports (e.g., Al-Maktoum, Dubai, and Sharjah) may use this role to request support from aerodrome controllers.

!!! example
    @ATC Support Requests, Currently on OMDB_APP covering OMDB, OMDW, and OMSJ top-down with traffic on the ground. Would appreciate any aerodrome controllers.

#### 10.4 ATC Relief Requests
Controllers planning to leave their position but whose departure would cause significant disruption should use this role. This includes situations where closing the position would increase the workload of a higher-level position within the top-down hierarchy. The role should be used in the discord channel 🚩│atc-marketplace and repeated incorrect use of this request may result in the revocation of the ability to use the role.

!!! example
    @ATC Relief Requests, About to leave OTHH_1_TWR in 10 minutes, 10 aircraft on the ground with no DEL/GND with a busy OTDF_1_CTR above. Aerodrome relief would be appreciated.

#### 10.5 ATC Event Requests
The following role is used by the Arabian vACC Events & Marketing Department to request controllers to express their interest in specific positions for upcoming events.

#### 10.6 vACC Announcements      
The following role is used by the Arabian vACC Leadership team to inform controllers of important vACC annoucements.

#### 10.7 Training Announcements      
The following role is used by the Arabian vACC ATC Training Department to inform controllers if there is training sessions, updates to training or anything related to the ATC Training department.

#### 10.8 Operational Announcements     
The following role is used by the Arabian vACC Operations Department to inform controllers of any SOP, Library, Sector file changes along with anything related to the Operations Department.

#### 10.9 Marketing Announcements
