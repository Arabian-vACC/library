# 5. Arrival Procedures
## 5.1 Approach and runway assignment
### 5.1.1 Initial contact
On initial contact with aircraft, aircraft shall be assigned the arrival runway and expected approach type for the appropriate aerodrome.

If aircraft have not reported receipt of the ATIS information, they must also be passed the current QNH.

!!! example 
    “UAE7CN, Dubai Arrivals, expect ILS approach runway 30L, information F, QNH 1016”

Traffic shall also be requested to pass aircraft type if they have not already done so.

### 5.1.2 Instrument approach
In most cases, the ILS approach is the preferred approach type, however for D-APO operations, aircraft may be issued the visual approach in accordance with the conditions laid down in 5.1.3.

RNAV approaches are also available, however, should not be used unless specifically requested by the pilot, or due to any other reason such as ILS unserviceability.

### 5.1.3 Visual approach
Visual approaches may be initiated by ARR or requested by the pilot. Pilot acceptance of a visual approach means that they will be able to visually maintain safe terrain clearance and accepts responsibility for establishing a safe landing interval behind the preceding aircraft.

A visual approach may be initiated by ARR under the following conditions:

- The pilot concurs;
- The pilot reports the preceding aircraft in sight and accepts responsibility to maintain own separation;
- Wherever necessary, a caution of possible wake turbulence has been issued

If minimum wake turbulence separation cannot be maintained, controllers may offer pilots a visual approach, so they may maintain visual/wake turbulence separation from preceding traffic.

Visual approaches shall only be permitted if traffic is arriving straight in from IMPED/VUTEB. They shall not be permitted from the downwind.

### 5.1.4 Change of runway or approach type
A change of approach type or runway shall not be initiated by the controller within 30 NM of touchdown. Pilot initiated change of approach type/runway is permitted at any time.

## 5.2 Speed control
### 5.2.1 General
As far as practicable, aircraft shall be given speeds in compliance with 3.2.2, to maintain separation.

Where necessary for separation, speeds within the recommended speed range shall be used, provided the maximum or minimum speeds for the respective segment is not exceeded.

To reduce controller workload, aircraft may also be instructed to maintain published speeds on the STAR.

!!! example 
    “UAE7CN, maintain STAR speeds”

### 5.2.2 Published and recommended speeds
The speed limits and recommended speeds within different segments of the Dubai CTA is as follows:

| Speed range     | Recommended/Published speeds | Arrival segment     |
|-----------------|------------------------------|---------------------|
| 210 - 250 knots | 230 - 250 knots         | CTA entry           |
| 190 - 230 knots | 210 knots; maximum for aircraft initiating turn from upwind to downwind leg | Approaching downwind |
| 180 - 210 knots | 190 knots; this must be enforced before handoff to Dubai Director (DIR) | From downwind to base leg |
| 170 - 210 knots | 170 - 190 knots          | Closing heading to final approach |
| 160 - 190 knots | 170 - 190 knots          | At 10 NM from touchdown |
| 160 knots       | 160 knots                | Until 4 NM from         |

### 5.2.3 Deviation from published and recommended speeds
Deviation from the recommended speeds from the downwind onwards is not recommended as the turn radius and turn rate becomes affected and may result in a localiser overshoot. In addition, it affords the controller more time to manage aircraft on the downwind.

For aircraft making a straight-in approach from the initial STAR fix, speed control need not be applied until the aircraft has established on the final approach course, or unless otherwise necessary for separation.

However, it is recommended that traffic is instructed maintain a maximum speed of 190 knots at 10 NM from the landing threshold to ensure approach stabilisation criteria can be met.

High speed may be permitted in the CTA provided the aircraft is not expected to make turns exceeding 30 degrees of course change at any given arrival segment and the traffic level and controller workload permits.

## 5.3 Descent profile
### 5.3.1 General
Descent clearances shall be issued in accordance with published level restrictions and the procedures laid down section 3 and section 4. Where aircraft are expected to follow the STAR vertical profile and comply with all published speed and level restrictions, the phrase “DESCEND VIA STAR TO *(CLEARED LEVEL)*" shall be used.

When using a “DESCEND VIA STAR” or “DESCEND UNRESTRICTED” clearance, aircraft shall not be cleared to descend below the next published at-or-above crossing restriction unless compliance with the restriction is assured assuming an idle thrust descent. This is to ensure that all relevant crossing restrictions are met despite an incorrectly programmed FMS or inappropriate use of aircraft automation.

Aircraft shall not be instructed to descend lower than the current minimum radar altitude to ensure obstacle and terrain clearance.

Intermediate levels may be used to ensure traffic separation between arrivals.

## 5.4 Final approach sequencing
### 5.4.1 Final descent
Descent for final approach shall be to the appropriate platform altitude for the respective runway as provided in 5.4.3.

Clearances to descend below the platform altitude are not recommended, however, this may be permitted provided that they are not below the minimum radar manoeuvring altitude for the sector and horizontal separation is assured with other traffic.

Due consideration shall be given to aircraft on opposite downwind legs. Descent clearances to the same level for aircraft on opposite downwind are not recommended to avoid a loss of separation in case of a localiser overshoot.

### 5.4.2 Sequencing requirements
At all times, it shall be the endeavour of the sequencing sector to maximise runway utilisation by achieving the minimum safe separation between traffic on final approach. Large gaps in the sequence must be avoided, as this reduces hourly arrival rate.

Notwithstanding the above, minimum traffic separation in the base-to-final segment shall be ensured at all times. Due consideration shall be given to enhanced wake turbulence category, aircraft performance and landing runway when sequencing base-to-final.

Speed control shall be applied in the same manner as provided in 5.2.2 in order to achieve desired separation.

If separation cannot be maintained, aircraft may be instructed to maintain visual wake turbulence separation if meteorological conditions permit. If this is not possible, aircraft shall be sent around and re-sequenced.

### 5.4.3 Use of standard headings
**Standard 90-degree base-legs and 30-degree intercepts shall be used** when vectoring aircraft from the downwind.

| Location | Runway direction | Headings |
|----------|--------|---------|
| South downwind | 30 | 030 degrees, base leg<br>330 degrees, intercept heading |
| North downwind | 30 | 210 degrees, base leg<br>270 degrees, intercept heading |
| South downwind | 12 | 030 degrees, base leg<br>090 degrees, intercept heading |
| North downwind | 12 | 210 degrees, base leg<br>150 degrees, intercept heading |

## 5.5 Longitudinal separation requirements
### 5.5.1 Dual runway operations
During simultaneous independent runway operations in segregated mode, minimum radar separation, or wake turbulence separation, if applicable, shall be maintained between arriving aircraft.

### 5.5.2 Single runway operations
For single runway operations, minimum longitudinal separation of **7 NM** shall be applied between arriving aircraft.

Lower separation may be used after coordination with AIR during periods of low departure activity. However, in case a departure is to be released between arrivals, the aforementioned separation shall be applied in order to "slot-in" the departing traffic.

If lower separation is coordinated, the separation requirements in 5.4.4.1 shall still apply.

### 5.5.3 Low-visibility operations
When operating under LVO conditions, minimum longitudinal separation of **7 NM** shall always be applied between arriving aircraft.

## 5.6 Platform altitudes
### 5.6.1 Dubai (OMDB)
Traffic establishing on final approach course at Dubai shall be cleared to a level as follows.

The platform altitudes provided below shall be mandatory during all operations. 

| Arrival runway | Final descent |
|----------------|---------------|
| OMDB 30L | 2000 ft |
| OMDB 30R | 3000 ft |
| OMDB 12L | 2000 ft |

### 5.6.2 Sharjah (OMSJ)
Traffic establishing on final approach course at Sharjah shall be cleared to a level as follows. 

| Arrival runway | Final descent |
|----------------|---------------|
| OMSJ 30 | 2000 ft |
| OMSJ 12 | 2000 ft |

### 5.6.3 Al Maktoum (OMDW)
Traffic establishing on final approach course at Al Maktoum shall be cleared to a level as follows. 

| Arrival runway | Final descent |
|----------------|---------------|
| OMDW 30 | 2000 ft |
| OMDW 12 | 2000 ft |

## 5.7 Lateral profile
### 5.7.1 General
The lateral profile of the STARs within the Dubai CTA is designed to keep arriving traffic separated from departures, as well as from arrivals into other airports. However, when the traffic situation permits, aircraft may be given direct routings to shorten track miles.

### 5.7.2 Direct routings
Direct routings within the Dubai CTA shall only be permitted provided traffic levels are low. If a direct routing is issued, due consideration must be given to any potential conflicts that may arise. As such, there are limitations on the directs that may be given to arriving traffic.

In addition, directs may be issued from the “trombone” portion of the arrival straight to a fix on the downwind to aid in sequencing traffic. This method is preferred during periods of high intensity arrivals as opposed to vectors as it minimises controller workload.

### 5.7.3 Direct routing procedure
