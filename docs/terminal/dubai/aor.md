# 3. Areas of Responsibility
## 3.1 General
### 3.1.1 Concept
The Dubai CTA Areas of Responsibility (AoR) are designed to minimise the need for coordination between sectors when climbing and descending traffic. This reduces controller workload, and allows a predictable flow of traffic through a complex network of SIDs and STARs.

These AoRs must be adhered to in order to prevent possible loss of separation between traffic.

### 3.1.2 Level clearances
Where traffic is to be given a climb or descent to the vertical boundary of an AoR, the descent clearance shall be 500 ft offset from the AoR boundary.

For example, if the AoR boundary is 7500 ft, a descent clearance may only be given to a minimum altitude of 8000 ft. Similarly, climbing traffic reaching the same AoR boundary may only be given a maximum altitude of 7000 ft.

Clearances per the AoRs will facilitate compliance with published level restrictions.

### 3.1.3 Transfer of control
Where aircraft cross between adjacent AoRs, transfer of control shall be made to the respective controller in accordance with the transfer procedures given in section 4.
