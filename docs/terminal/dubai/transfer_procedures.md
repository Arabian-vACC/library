# 4. Transfer Procedures
## 4.1 Compliance with procedures
The transfer procedures mentioned hereunder shall be adhered to at all times. These procedures are release agreements between different Dubai CTA sectors, as well as between UAE enroute sectors and the Dubai CTA.

Any deviation from these procedures shall required coordination between all concerned sectors.

## 4.2 Transfer from Arrivals (APP) to Director (FIN)
Traffic shall always be handed off to FIN with a speed restriction on 190 knots unless otherwise coordinated (e.g. for a straight-in approach).

In case it is not possible for APP to transfer traffic at the agreed level as described hereunder, traffic may be transferred at 6000 ft, 5000 ft, and 4000 ft with vertical separation assured without coordinating with FIN.
