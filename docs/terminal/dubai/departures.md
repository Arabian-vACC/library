# 6. Departure Procedures
## 6.1 Longitudinal separation requirements
Except as provided in 6.3, all aircraft departing the Dubai CTA via a common exit point shall be separated longitudinally by at least **8 NM constant or increasing**.

If this is not possible, the trailing aircraft shall be handed to UAE Radar in climbing or level flight with a cleared altitude of 13,000 feet once separation is assured.

In the 30 configuration, when vectoring DAVMO departures for separation, aircraft shall only be vectored to the East to avoid infringement of Tehran FIR airspace.

## 6.2 Speed control
Aircraft may be instructed to maintain high speed below 10,000 ft to maximise the capacity of the departures segment and establish required longitudinal separation as soon as possible.

ANVIX departures from 30 at OMDB shall not be instructed to maintain high speed until all initial turns have been completed.

To reduce controller workload, aircraft may also be instructed to maintain published speeds on the SID.

## 6.3 Muscat FIR flow control
Special flow control procedures may be required for traffic entering the Muscat FIR via certain entry points after departure from UAE airports. When flow control measures are in place, the following longitudinal separation requirements shall apply.

Where multiple airports share a common FIR exit point, longitudinal separation between traffic shall be assured before reaching the FIR boundary. 

| Departure aerodrome |    SID     | FIR exit point | Speed control | Longitudinal separation |
|---------------------|------------|----------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| OMDB/OMDW/OMSJ      | ANVIX      | TARDI          | 290 knots     | 20 NM (3 minutes)       |
| OMDB/OMSJ           | IVURO      | LALDO/GOMTA    | 290 knots     | 20 NM (3 minutes)       |
| OMDW                | NOLSU      | LALDO/GOMTA    | 290 knots     | 20 NM (3 minutes)       |

*Note: LALDO and GOMTA are to be considered a common FIR exit point. These procedures do not apply to traffic landing at Oman airports.*

## 6.4 Lateral profile
### 6.4.1 General
The lateral profile of the SIDs within the Dubai CTA is designed to keep arriving traffic separated from departures, as well as from arrivals into other airports. However, when the traffic situation permits, or when required for separation, aircraft may be given direct routings to shorten track miles.

### 6.4.2 Direct routings
#### 6.4.2.1 Issuance
Direct routings within the Dubai CTA shall only be permitted within each specified AoR. If a direct routing is issued, due consideration must be given to any potential conflicts that may arise. As such, there are limitations on the directs that may be given to traffic.

Direct routings across AoR boundaries shall not be permitted, except in specific cases, and only after coordination between all concerned sectors. Permitted direct routings across AoR boundaries are specified hereunder.

The transfer procedures specified in section 4 shall be applied in the same manner when direct routings are used. AoR vertical limits shall be respected at all times unless release has been specifically coordinated.

#### 6.4.2.2 CTA 30 operation
Only cross-AoR directs specified in the table below shall be permitted. Pre-coordinated directs do not require coordination, provided all required conditions are met.

| Departure aerodrome |    SID      | Direct | Conditions | Coordination sectors |
|---------------------|-------------|--------|------------|----------------------|
| OMDB      | KUTLI 4F | Direct KUTLI | Traffic will cross Area M3 above 11,000 ft | pre-coordinated |
| OMSJ      | RIDAP 2R, SENPA 2R, NABIX 3R | Direct ORLAD | Traffic above 5000 ft and no conflict with OMDB departures | DEP 2 to DEP 1 |
| OMSJ      | RIDAP 2R, SENPA 2R, NABIX 3R | From ORLAD direct RIDAP/SENPA/NABIX | None | pre-coordinated |
| OMSJ      | ANVIX 5R | Direct ANVIX | Traffic above 9000 ft  | DEP 2 to AMR |
| OMSJ      | KUTLI 3R | Direct KUTLI | Traffic above 9000 ft  | DEP 2 to DEP 1 |
| OMDW      | RIDAP 3L | Direct RIDAP | No traffic via SENPA or NABIX | AMR to DEP 1 |
| OMDW      | RIDAP 3L | Direct TUMAK | No traffic via SENPA or NABIX | AMR to DEP 1 and ACC Delta,<br> or DEP 1 to ACC Delta |
| OMDW      | SENPA 3L | Direct SENPA | No traffic via NABIX | AMR to DEP 1 |
| OMDW      | SENPA 3L | Direct ALPOB | No traffic via NABIX | AMR to DEP 1 and ACC Delta,<br> or DEP 1 to ACC Delta |

!!! important
    In all instances, departing aircraft shall **not be permitted to cross north of ORLAD** to avoid infringement of UAE delegated airspace

    Traffic turning right after departure from OMSJ shall **not be issued a direct routing until commencement of the turn**, in order to prevent overflying OM(P)-45

    Direct KUTLI shall not be permitted if OM(AS)-03 or OM(AS)-04 are active until aircraft are clear of these areas.

#### 6.4.2.3 CTA 12 operation
Only cross-AoR directs specified in the table below shall be permitted. Pre-coordinated directs do not require coordination, provided all required conditions are met.

| Departure aerodrome |    SID      | Direct | Conditions | Coordination sectors |
|---------------------|-------------|--------|------------|----------------------|
| OMDB      | KUTLI 3Q | Direct KUTLI | Traffic will cross Area M3 above 11,000 ft | pre-coordinated |
| OMSJ      | RIDAP 3Q, SENPA 3Q, NABIX 3Q | Direct ORLAD | Traffic above 5000 ft and no conflict with OMDB departures | DEP 2 to DEP 1 |
| OMSJ      | RIDAP 3Q, SENPA 3Q, NABIX 3Q | From ORLAD direct RIDAP/SENPA/NABIX | None | pre-coordinated |
| OMDW      | RIDAP 3J | Direct RIDAP | No traffic via SENPA or NABIX | AMR to DEP 1 |
| OMDW      | RIDAP 3J | Direct TUMAK | No traffic via SENPA or NABIX | AMR to DEP 1 and ACC Delta,<br> or DEP 1 to ACC Delta |
| OMDW      | SENPA 3J | Direct SENPA | No traffic via NABIX | AMR to DEP 1 |
| OMDW      | SENPA 3J | Direct ALPOB | No traffic via NABIX | AMR to DEP 1 and ACC Delta,<br> or DEP 1 to ACC Delta |

!!! important
    In all instances, departing aircraft shall **not be permitted to cross north of ORLAD** to avoid infringement of UAE delegated airspace
    
    Traffic departing OMDB shall **not be issued direct to RIDAP or SENPA** to avoid proximity to south downwind arrivals

    Direct KUTLI shall not be permitted if OM(AS)-03 or OM(AS)-04 are active until aircraft are clear of these areas.
