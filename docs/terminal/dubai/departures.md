# 6. Departure Procedures
## 6.1 Longitudinal separation requirements
Except as provided in 6.3, all aircraft departing the Dubai CTA via a common exit point shall be separated longitudinally by at least **8 NM constant or increasing**.

If this is not possible, the trailing aircraft shall be handed to UAE Radar in climbing or level flight with a cleared altitude of 13,000 feet once separation is assured.

In the 30 configuration, when vectoring DAVMO departures for separation, aircraft shall only be vectored to the East to avoid infringement of Tehran FIR airspace.

## 6.2 Speed control
Aircraft may be instructed to maintain high speed below 10,000 ft to maximise the capacity of the departures segment and establish required longitudinal separation as soon as possible.

ANVIX departures from 30 at OMDB shall not be instructed to maintain high speed until all initial turns have been completed.

To reduce controller workload, aircraft may also be instructed to maintain published speeds on the SID.

## 6.3 Muscat FIR flow control
Special flow control procedures may be required for traffic entering the Muscat FIR via certain entry points after departure from UAE airports. When flow control measures are in place, the following longitudinal separation requirements shall apply.

Where multiple airports share a common FIR exit point, longitudinal separation between traffic shall be assured before reaching the FIR boundary. 

| Departure aerodrome |    SID     | FIR exit point | Speed control | Longitudinal separation |
|---------------------|------------|----------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| OMDB/OMDW/OMSJ      | ANVIX      | TARDI          | 290 knots     | 20 NM (3 minutes)       |
| OMDB/OMSJ           | IVURO      | LALDO/GOMTA    | 290 knots     | 20 NM (3 minutes)       |
| OMDW                | NOLSU      | LALDO/GOMTA    | 290 knots     | 20 NM (3 minutes)       |

*Note: LALDO and GOMTA are to be considered a common FIR exit point. These procedures do not apply to traffic landing at Oman airports.*
