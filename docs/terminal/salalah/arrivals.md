# 3. Arrivals
## 3.1 STAR, Approach, and Runway Assignment
### 3.1.1 Initial Contact
On initial contact, arriving aircraft shall report the current ATIS information to confirm awareness of the active runway. If ATIS is not reported, controllers shall provide the current ATIS identifier along with the designated arrival runway. Additionally, the expected approach type (e.g., ILS, RNP, or VOR) shall be communicated.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Salalah Radar, good evening, QTR68U passing FL210 for 8,000 ft on the ASTUN1H arrival. Information C on board."

    **Controller**: "QTR68U, Salalah Radar, good evening, identified, expect ILS approach runway 25, information C correct."

    **Pilot**: "Expect ILS approach runway 25, QTR68U."

If an aircraft has not confirmed receipt of the ATIS information, the current QNH must be communicated to them.

### 3.1.2 STAR Assignment
The Salalah Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA) offers two types of arrival procedures: RNAV arrivals and conventional arrivals based on the Salalah VOR (SLL). RNAV arrivals shall be assigned by default. Aircraft unable to fly RNAV procedures due to equipment limitations shall be assigned a conventional arrival.

#### 3.1.2.3 Radar Vectoring
Controllers shall exercise caution when vectoring aircraft off published procedures, as responsibility for terrain clearance is transferred to the controller. All vectors shall remain within the limits of the published Minimum Radar Vectoring Altitudes (MRVA).

### 3.1.3 Instrument Approach
#### 3.1.3.1 ILS Approach
The ILS approach shall be the preferred approach type for arrivals. Aircraft may be cleared for a visual approach when the conditions outlined in Section 3.1.4 are met.

Radar-identified aircraft may be vectored off the STAR, provided they remain under positive radar control. When vectoring aircraft to final for the ILS, a base-to-final intercept angle shall not exceed 45 degrees, in accordance with ICAO standards.

A procedural base turn is also available and published as part of the approach based on the Salalah (SLL) VOR.

#### 3.1.3.2 RNP Approach
RNP approaches shall only be assigned if specifically requested by the pilot or when required due to operational circumstances such as ILS unserviceability. Radar-identified aircraft may be vectored off the STAR, provided they remain under positive radar control.

When assigning RNP approaches, controllers shall ensure the aircraft is established at the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) and within the published protected entry sector. For RNP procedures, the protected intercept area is generally within a 110-degree arc centred on the IAF. Aircraft are required to commence RNP approaches from the designated IAF unless the procedure permits otherwise.

#### 3.1.3.3 VOR Approach
VOR approaches shall only be assigned if specifically requested by the pilot or when required due to circumstances such as ILS unserviceability or GPS outage. Radar-identified aircraft may be vectored off the STAR provided they remain under positive radar control.

When clearing aircraft for a VOR approach, controllers shall ensure the aircraft is established at the appropriate Initial Approach Fix (IAF) and within the protected 30-degree sector for interception. VOR procedures must commence from the designated IAF unless otherwise published or authorized.

A procedure base turn is available and shall be conducted as published, based on the Salalah (SLL) VOR.

### 3.1.4 Visual Approach
Visual approaches may be initiated by Approach (APP) or requested by the pilot. When a pilot accepts a visual approach, they confirm their ability to visually maintain safe terrain clearance and take responsibility for ensuring a safe landing interval behind the preceding aircraft.  

APP may initiate a visual approach under the following conditions:

- The pilot agrees to the visual approach;  
- The pilot reports having the preceding aircraft in sight and accepts responsibility for maintaining separation;  
- A caution regarding potential wake turbulence has been issued, where applicable.  

If the minimum wake turbulence separation cannot be guaranteed, controllers may offer a visual approach, allowing the pilot to maintain visual and wake turbulence separation from preceding traffic.  

### 3.1.5 Change of Runway or Approach Type
Controllers must not initiate a change to the approach type or runway within 30 NM of touchdown. However, pilots may request a change to the approach type or runway at any time.  

## 3.2 Speed control
### 3.2.1 General
Whenever possible, aircraft should be assigned speeds in accordance with Section 3.2.2 to ensure separation is maintained.  

When required for separation, speeds within the recommended range may be used, as long as they do not exceed the maximum or minimum limits for the respective segment.  

### 3.2.2 Published and Recommended Speeds
The speed limits and recommended speeds within different segments of the Salalah terminal area is as follows:

|  Speed Range  |              Arrival Segment              |
|:-------------:|:-----------------------------------------:|
|    250 kts    |              Below 10,000 ft              |
| 230 - 210 kts |           Initial approach phase          |
|    180 kts    | Base leg/closed heading to final approach |
|    180 kts    |                Until 10 DME               |
|    160 kts    |                Until 4 DME                |

All speed restrictions must be adhered to as accurately as possible. Aircraft unable to comply with these restrictions must notify ATC in advance and specify the speeds they can maintain. Pilots should also inform ATC if circumstances require a speed adjustment for any reason.  

To ensure accurate spacing, pilots are requested to comply with speed adjustments as promptly as practicable, considering their operational constraints.  

If traffic sequencing does not require speed limitations, ATC will advise, “NO ATC SPEED RESTRICTION.”  

### 3.2.3 Deviation from Published and Recommended speeds
Deviation from the recommended speeds from the downwind onwards is not advised, as it affects the turn radius and turn rate, potentially leading to a localizer overshoot. Additionally, maintaining these speeds provides controllers with more time to manage aircraft on the downwind leg.  

For aircraft conducting a straight-in approach from the initial STAR fix, speed control is generally not required until the aircraft is established on the final approach course, unless necessary for separation.  

However, it is recommended that traffic be instructed to maintain a maximum speed of 180 knots when 10 NM from the landing threshold to ensure approach stabilization criteria are met.  

High speeds may be allowed in the terminal area (TMA) as long as the aircraft is not expected to make turns exceeding 30 degrees of course change in any given arrival segment, and provided the traffic level and controller workload permit.

## 3.3 Descent Profile
### 3.3.1 General
Descent clearances must be issued in accordance with published level restrictions and the procedures outlined in Sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3.  

When aircraft are expected to follow the STAR vertical profile and comply with all published speed and level restrictions, the phrase "`DESCEND VIA STAR TO <cleared altitude/level>`" shall be used.  

When issuing a "`DESCEND VIA STAR`" or "`DESCEND UNRESTRICTED`" clearance, aircraft must not be cleared to descend below the next published at-or-above crossing restriction unless compliance with that restriction is assured, assuming an idle thrust descent. This ensures all crossing restrictions are met, even in the case of an incorrectly programmed FMS or improper use of aircraft automation.  

Aircraft should not be cleared to descend below the current minimum radar altitude to ensure sufficient obstacle and terrain clearance.  

Intermediate levels may be assigned to ensure proper traffic separation between arrivals.

## 3.4 Lateral Profile
### 3.4.1 General
The lateral profile of the STARs within the Salalah TMA is designed to keep arriving traffic separated from departures. However, when the traffic situation permits, aircraft may be given direct routings to shorten track miles. 

### 3.4.2 Direct Routings
Direct routings within the Salalah TMA shall only be issued when traffic levels permit. When providing a direct routing, controllers must assess and ensure separation from any potential conflicting traffic. Directs shall only be issued to the Initial Approach Fix (IAF).

## 3.5 Final Approach Sequencing
### 3.5.1 Final Descent
Descent to the final approach segment shall be cleared to the published platform altitude for the respective runway, as depicted on the applicable instrument approach chart.

Descent below the platform altitude is generally not recommended. However, it may be permitted if the aircraft remains above the published Minimum Radar Vectoring Altitude (MRVA) for the sector and horizontal separation with other traffic is assured.

## 3.5.2 Final Sequencing
- **Radar separation** shall be maintained at all times in the **base-to-final segment**.  
- When sequencing aircraft, controllers shall give due consideration to:
    - **Wake turbulence categories**,  
    - **Aircraft performance**, and  
    - **Assigned landing runway**.

- **Speed control** shall be applied in accordance with the procedures outlined in **Section 3.2.2**.

- If standard separation cannot be maintained:
    - Aircraft may be instructed to apply **visual separation for wake turbulence**, provided **meteorological conditions permit** and both aircraft are in visual contact.
    - If visual separation is **not possible**, the affected aircraft shall be instructed to **go around** and shall be **re-sequenced** accordingly.

- When vectoring from the downwind leg:
    - A **standard 90-degree base leg** followed by a **30-degree intercept angle to final** shall be used.

## 3.5.3 Longitudinal Separation Requirements
A minimum longitudinal separation of 7 NM shall be applied between arriving aircraft, unless alternate separation has been specifically coordinated with the appropriate AIR controller.

## 3.5.4 Platform Altitudes
| Type | Runway | Platform Altitude |
|:----:|:------:|:-----------------:|
|  ILS |   07   |      3,400 ft     |
