# 2. General Procedures
## 2.1 General provisions
The Approach Control Radar ensures surveillance-based separation services for arriving aircraft, as well as between arriving and departing aircraft, within the Salalah Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA). This encompasses Salalah International Airport (SLL/OOSA).

Additionally, radar control services are extended to aircraft operating within the boundaries of the Salalah TMA, including those departing to or arriving from adjacent airspaces, as necessary.

## 2.2 Separation minima
### 2.2.1 Surveillance-based separation
Unless specified otherwise in sections 2.2.2 and 4.1.1, aircraft operating within the Salalah TMA must maintain a minimum horizontal separation of **3 NM**. If this cannot be achieved, a minimum vertical separation of **1,000 ft** must be applied.

Controllers are required to employ suitable speed and altitude instructions, along with lateral profile adjustments, to ensure adherence to the prescribed separation minima.

### 2.2.2 Wake turbulence separation
The applicable ICAO Wake Turbulence Separation Minima must always be enforced for aircraft operating below **10,000 ft** under the following conditions:

- When an aircraft is directly behind another at the same altitude or within **1,000 ft** below.  
- When both aircraft are utilizing the same runway or parallel runways separated by less than **760 meters**.  
- When an aircraft is crossing behind another at the same altitude or within **1,000 ft** below.  

## 2.4 Designated areas of responsibility
### 2.4.1 General
The Salalah TMA is operated solely by the Salalah Radar position. No additional radar or control positions are available within the TMA.

### 2.4.2 Coordination between controllers
Clearances for direct routing to waypoints, radar vectors before the downwind leg, or deviations from standard level clearances within designated controller Areas of Responsibility (AoRs) must not be issued without prior coordination between the relevant controllers.  

Handoffs between controllers must be conducted early enough to allow the next sectors to facilitate continuous climb or descent, provided no conflicts exist with other traffic and separation is maintained.  

### 2.4.4 Handoff procedure
#### 2.4.4.1 General
All departure and arrival traffic shall be handed off to the appropriate Muscat enroute sector upon exiting the lateral or vertical limits of the Salalah TMA. Handoffs must be initiated in a timely manner—ideally prior to the TMA boundary or when aircraft are 1,000 to 2,000 feet below their cleared altitude—to facilitate early coordination and allow for anticipated climb.

### 2.4.5 Sector top-down coverage
When the lower sector is offline, Salalah Radar shall provide top-down coverage for Salalah in addition to its designated areas of responsibility.
