# 4. Departures
## 4.1 Longitudinal Separation
### 4.1.1 Separation Requirements
All aircraft departing the Salalah TMA via a common exit point shall be separated longitudinally by at least 8 NM constant or increasing. 

If this is not possible, the trailing aircraft shall be handed to Muscat Control in climbing or level flight with a cleared altitude of 13,000 ft once separation is assured. 

### 4.1.2 Speed Control
Aircraft may be instructed to maintain high speed below 10,000 ft to maximise the capacity of the departures segment and establish required longitudinal separation as soon as possible.

## 4.2 Climb
### 4.2.1 General
Climb clearances shall be issued in accordance with published level restrictions and the procedures laid down in 4.2.2 and 4.2.3. Where aircraft are expected to follow the SID vertical profile and comply with all published speed and level restrictions, the phrase “CLIMB VIA SID TO <cleared level>” shall be used. 

The climb procedures in 4.2.2 and 4.2.3 shall be used as a guide to highlight interactions between the departure and arrival procedures within the Salalah TMA and assume that all intersecting departures and arrivals are active.  

If no conflicts are anticipated, aircraft may be cleared to climb to the highest allowable level provided there has been prior coordination between all concerned sectors.

## 4.3 Lateral Profile
### 4.3.1 General
Due to terrain constraints in the northern sector, the lateral routing of Standard Instrument Departures (SIDs) within the Salalah TMA is limited. As a result, departures and arrivals—particularly those operating on conventional procedures based on DME arcs—are likely to converge. Aircraft may be issued radar vectors for deconfliction upon departure from the TMA. However, positive radar identification is required before vectoring, and all minimum radar vectoring altitudes must be strictly observed.

Direct routings within the Salalah TMA shall only be permitted provided traffic levels are low. If a direct routing is issued, due consideration must be given to any potential conflicts that may arise.
