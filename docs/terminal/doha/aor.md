# 3. Designated areas of responsibility (AoR)
## 3.1 General
To reduce workload during peak periods, the Doha TMA may be divided into a maximum of seven sectors. Each sector is assigned specific departures and arrivals and must adhere to standard level clearance and handoff procedures to maintain separation.  

## 3.2 Coordination between controllers
Clearances for direct routing to waypoints, radar vectors before the downwind leg, or deviations from standard level clearances within designated controller Areas of Responsibility (AoRs) must not be issued without prior coordination between the relevant controllers.  

Handoffs between controllers must be conducted early enough to allow the next sectors to facilitate continuous climb or descent, provided no conflicts exist with other traffic and separation is maintained.
