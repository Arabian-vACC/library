# 2. General Procedures
## 2.1 General provisions
The Approach Control Radar ensures surveillance-based separation services for arriving aircraft, as well as between arriving and departing aircraft, within the Doha Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA). This encompasses Doha International Airport (DIA/OTBD), Hamad International Airport (DOH/OTHH), and Al-Udaid Airbase (OTBH).

Additionally, radar control services are extended to aircraft operating within the boundaries of the Doha TMA, including those departing to or arriving from adjacent airspaces, as necessary.

## 2.2 Separation minima
### 2.2.1 Surveillance-based separation
Unless specified otherwise in sections 2.2.2 and 4.1.1, aircraft operating within the Doha TMA must maintain a minimum horizontal separation of **3 NM**. If this cannot be achieved, a minimum vertical separation of **1,000 ft** must be applied.

Controllers are required to employ suitable speed and altitude instructions, along with lateral profile adjustments, to ensure adherence to the prescribed separation minima.

### 2.2.2 Wake turbulence separation
The applicable Recategorisation Wake Turbulence Separation Minima (**RECAT**) must always be enforced for aircraft operating below **6,000 ft** under the following conditions:

- When an aircraft is directly behind another at the same altitude or within **1,000 ft** below.  
- When both aircraft are utilizing the same runway or parallel runways separated by less than **760 meters**.  
- When an aircraft is crossing behind another at the same altitude or within **1,000 ft** below.  

## 2.3 Doha TMA runway configuration
Due to the interactions between departure and arrival procedures, the runway direction in the Doha TMA is determined by the active runway configuration at Hamad (OTHH). Consequently, Doha (OTBD) and Al-Udaid (OTBH) must always operate in the same runway configuration as Hamad.
