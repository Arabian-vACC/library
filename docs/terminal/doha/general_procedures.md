# 2. General Procedures
## 2.1 General provisions
The Approach Control Radar ensures surveillance-based separation services for arriving aircraft, as well as between arriving and departing aircraft, within the Doha Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA). This encompasses Doha International Airport (DIA/OTBD), Hamad International Airport (DOH/OTHH), and Al-Udaid Airbase (OTBH).

Additionally, radar control services are extended to aircraft operating within the boundaries of the Doha TMA, including those departing to or arriving from adjacent airspaces, as necessary.

## 2.2 Separation minima
### 2.2.1 Surveillance-based separation
Unless specified otherwise in sections 2.2.2 and 4.1.1, aircraft operating within the Doha TMA must maintain a minimum horizontal separation of **3 NM**. If this cannot be achieved, a minimum vertical separation of **1,000 ft** must be applied.

Controllers are required to employ suitable speed and altitude instructions, along with lateral profile adjustments, to ensure adherence to the prescribed separation minima.

### 2.2.2 Wake turbulence separation
The applicable Recategorisation Wake Turbulence Separation Minima (**RECAT**) must always be enforced for aircraft operating below **6,000 ft** under the following conditions:

- When an aircraft is directly behind another at the same altitude or within **1,000 ft** below.  
- When both aircraft are utilizing the same runway or parallel runways separated by less than **760 meters**.  
- When an aircraft is crossing behind another at the same altitude or within **1,000 ft** below.  

## 2.3 Doha TMA runway configuration
Due to the interactions between departure and arrival procedures, the runway direction in the Doha TMA is determined by the active runway configuration at Hamad (OTHH). Consequently, Doha (OTBD) and Al-Udaid (OTBH) must always operate in the same runway configuration as Hamad.  

## 2.4 Designated areas of responsibility
### 2.4.1 General
To manage controller workload during peak traffic periods, the **Doha Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA)** may be sectorized into **a maximum of seven (7) sectors**. Each sector shall be assigned specific departure and arrival responsibilities and must adhere strictly to standard level assignment, coordination, and handoff procedures to ensure safe and efficient separation of traffic.

- **Doha Radar**  
  Responsible for air traffic within **Doha TMA 3** from **12,000 feet up to FL245**.

- **Doha Approach**  
  Responsible for air traffic within **Doha TMA 1, 1A, and 2** from **12,000 feet down to 4,000 feet**.

- **Doha Director**  
  Responsible for managing **downwind traffic** from **4,000 feet and below**.

### 2.4.2 Coordination between controllers
Clearances for direct routing to waypoints, radar vectors before the downwind leg, or deviations from standard level clearances within designated controller Areas of Responsibility (AoRs) must not be issued without prior coordination between the relevant controllers.  

Handoffs between controllers must be conducted early enough to allow the next sectors to facilitate continuous climb or descent, provided no conflicts exist with other traffic and separation is maintained.

### 2.4.5 Sector order
Unless explicitly authorized by the Arabian vACC staff, sectors within the Doha TMA must be opened in the specified order.  

Each active sector requires a prerequisite sector to be online before further divisions of the TMA are made. If a prerequisite sector goes offline, the TMA must revert to the previous configuration.  

Sectors not included in this priority order may be opened at any time.  

| Online Sector |       Next sector to open      |           Prerequisite sector          |
|:-------------:|:------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------:|

### 2.4.6 Sector top-down coverage
When the lower sector is offline, Doha Radar shall provide top-down coverage for Doha in addition to its designated areas of responsibility. This responsibility transitions to Doha Approach when it is online. Controllers are strongly encouraged to obtain the Tier-2 Military Endorsement to ensure proficiency in delivering military air traffic services at Al-Udeid Airbase (OTBH).
