# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 Purpose & Scope
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the procedures, responsibilities, and coordination requirements for enroute air traffic control operations within the Doha Terminal Manouvering Area (TMA) on the VATSIM network. Its primary goal is to ensure safe, efficient, and standardized handling of IFR and VFR traffic across all departure and arrivals sectors.

This document serves as a reference for both newly certified and experienced controllers operating within the Doha Terminal Manouvering Area (TMA), providing detailed guidance on sector operations, inter-sector coordination, traffic management, and the use of tools and systems such as TopSky ATM.

While this SOP focuses specifically on departure and arrival operations, it complements other local SOPs, including those for Doha-Hamad & Doha Aerodromes, as well as Letters of Agreement (LoAs) with adjacent FIRs.

## 1.2 Applicability
This SOP is applicable to all VATSIM air traffic controllers operating within the Doha Terminal Manouvering Area (TMA) at a departure or arrivals level, including:

- Doha TMA Radar, Approach, and Finals controllers.
- Controllers operating in a top-down capacity from a radar/approach (APP) position.
- Visiting controllers approved by the relevant division or vACC.
- Trainees working under supervision within TMA airspace.

All controllers are expected to adhere to the procedures set forth in this document in conjunction with the VATSIM Global Controller Ratings Policy, the VATSIM Code of Conduct, and applicable local policies.

## 1.3 Authority & Oversight
The development, maintenance, and enforcement of this SOP fall under the authority of the ATC Operations Department and the Arabian vACC leadership. Oversight is coordinated in line with regional and divisional policies set by the **Middle East & North Africa Division (VATMENA)** and the **VATSIM Network**.

Amendments or updates to this SOP may be issued as needed to reflect procedural changes, software updates, or coordination adjustments with neighboring FIRs. All controllers are responsible for remaining up to date with the latest version of this SOP and any associated supplements or notices.
