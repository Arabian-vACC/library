# 4. Transfer Procedures
## 4.1 General
The transfer procedures mentioned hereunder shall be adhered to at all times. These procedures are release agreements between different Doha TMA sectors.

Any deviation from these procedures shall required coordination between all concerned sectors.

The AoRs represented hereunder with alphanumeric identifiers, are the same as those defined in section 3.

## 4.2 Transfer from Arrivals (ARR) to Director (DIR)
Traffic shall always be handed off to DIR with a speed restriction on **190 knots** unless otherwise coordinated (e.g. for a straight-in approach).

Hand offs to DIR must be at **6000FT** when arriving on the downwind legs.
