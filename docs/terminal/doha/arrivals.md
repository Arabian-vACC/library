# 3. Arrivals
## 3.1 STAR, Approach, and Runway assignment
### 3.1.1 STAR
As most arrivals contact Doha Radar directly, it is the responsibility of Doha Radar to assign the STAR. The Doha TMA offers various types of STARs, including a trombone-style arrival, a shorter arrival, and a STAR leading to one of the downwind legs.  

By default, aircraft shall be assigned trombone-style arrivals. During periods of low traffic, they may be assigned a STAR that takes them directly to the downwind without routing through the trombone.  

It is important to note that trombone-style arrivals can be divided into two distinct procedures for each downwind. For instance, the HAYYA1R procedure directs aircraft to a downwind east of the aerodrome, while the HAYYA1L procedure directs them to a downwind west of the aerodrome.
