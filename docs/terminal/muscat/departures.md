# 4. Departures
## 4.1 Longitudinal Separation
### 4.1.1 Separation Requirements
All aircraft departing the Muscat TMA via a common exit point shall be separated longitudinally by at least 8 NM constant or increasing. 

If this is not possible, the trailing aircraft shall be handed to Muscat Control in climbing or level flight with a cleared altitude of 10,000 ft minimum or as per minimum radar vectoring altitudes (MRVA) once separation is assured. 

### 4.1.2 Speed Control
Aircraft may be instructed to maintain high speed below 10,000 ft to maximise the capacity of the departures segment and establish required longitudinal separation as soon as possible.

## 4.2 Climb
### 4.2.1 General
As all **Standard Instrument Departures (SIDs)** are currently **suspended** in the Muscat TMA, arrivals shall be managed using the following vertical separation rule:

- **Departures** shall be assigned **ODD** altitudes or flight levels.  
- **Arrivals** shall be assigned **EVEN** altitudes or flight levels.

Controllers shall **not clear aircraft to climb below the applicable Minimum Radar Vectoring Altitude (MRVA)** in the area, in order to maintain safe **obstacle and terrain clearance**.

If no conflicts are anticipated, aircraft may be cleared to climb to the highest allowable level provided there has been prior coordination between all concerned sectors. 

## 4.3 Lateral Profile
### 4.3.1 General
Due to terrain constraints in the northern sector, the lateral routing of Standard Instrument Departures (SIDs) within the Muscat TMA is limited. As a result, departures and arrivals—particularly those operating on conventional procedures based on DME arcs—are likely to converge. Aircraft may be issued radar vectors for deconfliction upon departure from the TMA. However, positive radar identification is required before vectoring, and all minimum radar vectoring altitudes must be strictly observed.

Direct routings within the Muscat TMA shall only be permitted provided traffic levels are low. If a direct routing is issued, due consideration must be given to any potential conflicts that may arise. 

### 4.3.1 General
As all **Standard Instrument Departures (SIDs)** are currently **suspended** in the Muscat TMA, departures shall be managed via radar vectors and then given a direct to join their cleared airway as required.

### 3.4.2 Direct Routings
Direct routings within the Muscat TMA shall only be issued when traffic levels permit. When providing a direct routing, controllers must assess and ensure separation from any potential conflicting traffic. Directs shall only be issued to the Initial Approach Fix (IAF).
