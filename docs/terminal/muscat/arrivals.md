# 3. Arrivals
## 3.1 STAR, Approach, and Runway Assignment
### 3.1.1 Initial Contact
On initial contact, arriving aircraft shall report the current ATIS information to confirm awareness of the active runway. If ATIS is not reported, controllers shall provide the current ATIS identifier along with the designated arrival runway. Additionally, the expected approach type (e.g., ILS, RNP, or VOR) shall be communicated.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Muscat Approach, good evening, OMA224 passing FL250 for 10,000 ft inbound MCT. Information C on board."

    **Controller**: "OMA224, Muscat Approach, good evening, identified, expect ILS approach runway 08L, information C correct."

    **Pilot**: "Expect ILS approach runway 08L, OMA224."

If an aircraft has not confirmed receipt of the ATIS information, the current QNH must be communicated to them.

### 3.1.2 STAR Assignment
The Muscat Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA) has published RNAV Standard Terminal Arrival Routings (STARs), which are the preferred arrival procedures for IFR aircraft, However, as of the current publication, these RNAV STARs are suspended due to ongoing aerodrome and airspace restructuring. Arriving aircraft can expect the following:

!!! warning
    Do not confuse a “Base Turn at MCT” with a standard 90-degree base turn. These are two distinct procedures.

    A Base Turn at MCT is a procedure turn, typically executed in a teardrop pattern, designed to position the aircraft for a stable intercept of the final approach track. It is not a tactical vector onto base leg.

    Controllers and pilots should consult the published approach charts for precise routing, altitude constraints, and the vertical profile depiction, which clearly illustrates the intended path of the procedure.

#### 3.1.2.3 Radar Vectoring
Controllers shall **exercise caution when vectoring aircraft off published procedures**, as doing so transfers **terrain clearance responsibility** to the controller.

- **All vectors must remain within the published Minimum Radar Vectoring Altitudes (MRVA).**
- When vectoring for **non-precision approaches**, aircraft must be positioned within defined **safety sectors** before being cleared for the approach. If an aircraft is not within the appropriate sector, the controller must either:
    - **Request pilot acceptance** of the deviation, **or**
    - **Re-vector** the aircraft to remain within the required safety sector.

Required Safety Sectors:

- **ILS Approaches**: Intercept final approach course at a **maximum of 30 degrees**.
- **RNP Approaches**: Aircraft must be within a **110-degree sector** from the **Initial Approach Fix (IAF)**.
- **VOR Approaches**: Aircraft must be within a **30-degree sector** from the **VOR station**.

Controllers shall **refer to published approach charts** and ensure vectoring complies with both **obstacle clearance** and **approach design parameters**.

### 3.1.3 Instrument Approach
#### 3.1.3.1 ILS Approach
The ILS approach shall be the preferred approach type for arrivals. Aircraft may be cleared for a visual approach when the conditions outlined in Section 3.1.4 are met.

Radar-identified aircraft shall be vectored for the ILS, provided they remain under positive radar control. When vectoring aircraft to final for the ILS, a base-to-final intercept angle shall not exceed 45 degrees, in accordance with ICAO standards.

A procedural base turn is also available and published as part of the approach based on the Muscat (MCT) VOR.

#### 3.1.3.2 RNP Approach
RNP approaches shall only be assigned if specifically requested by the pilot or when required due to operational circumstances such as ILS unserviceability. Radar-identified aircraft may be vectored off the STAR, provided they remain under positive radar control.

When assigning RNP approaches, controllers shall ensure the aircraft is established at the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) and within the published protected entry sector. For RNP procedures, the protected intercept area is generally within a 110-degree arc centred on the IAF. Aircraft are required to commence RNP approaches from the designated IAF unless the procedure permits otherwise.

#### 3.1.3.3 VOR Approach
VOR approaches shall only be assigned if specifically requested by the pilot or when required due to circumstances such as ILS unserviceability or GPS outage. Radar-identified aircraft may be vectored off the STAR provided they remain under positive radar control.

When clearing aircraft for a VOR approach, controllers shall ensure the aircraft is established at the appropriate Initial Approach Fix (IAF) and within the protected 30-degree sector for interception. VOR procedures must commence from the designated IAF unless otherwise published or authorized.

A procedure base turn is available and shall be conducted as published, based on the Muscat (MCT) VOR.

### 3.1.4 Visual Approach
Visual approaches may be initiated by Approach (APP) or requested by the pilot. When a pilot accepts a visual approach, they confirm their ability to visually maintain safe terrain clearance and take responsibility for ensuring a safe landing interval behind the preceding aircraft.  

APP may initiate a visual approach under the following conditions:

- The pilot agrees to the visual approach;  
- The pilot reports having the preceding aircraft in sight and accepts responsibility for maintaining separation;  
- A caution regarding potential wake turbulence has been issued, where applicable.  

If the minimum wake turbulence separation cannot be guaranteed, controllers may offer a visual approach, allowing the pilot to maintain visual and wake turbulence separation from preceding traffic.  

### 3.1.5 Change of Runway or Approach Type
Controllers must not initiate a change to the approach type or runway within 30 NM of touchdown. However, pilots may request a change to the approach type or runway at any time.  

## 3.2 Speed control
### 3.2.1 General
Whenever possible, aircraft should be assigned speeds in accordance with Section 3.2.2 to ensure separation is maintained.  

When required for separation, speeds within the recommended range may be used, as long as they do not exceed the maximum or minimum limits for the respective segment.  

### 3.2.2 Published and Recommended Speeds
The speed limits and recommended speeds within different segments of the Muscat terminal area is as follows:

|  Speed Range  |              Arrival Segment              |
|:-------------:|:-----------------------------------------:|
|    250 kts    |              Below 10,000 ft              |
| 230 - 210 kts |           Initial approach phase          |
|    180 kts    | Base leg/closed heading to final approach |
|    180 kts    |                Until 10 DME               |
|    160 kts    |                Until 4 DME                |

All speed restrictions must be adhered to as accurately as possible. Aircraft unable to comply with these restrictions must notify ATC in advance and specify the speeds they can maintain. Pilots should also inform ATC if circumstances require a speed adjustment for any reason.  

To ensure accurate spacing, pilots are requested to comply with speed adjustments as promptly as practicable, considering their operational constraints.  

If traffic sequencing does not require speed limitations, ATC will advise, “NO ATC SPEED RESTRICTION.”  

### 3.2.3 Deviation from Published and Recommended speeds
Deviation from the recommended speeds from the downwind onwards is not advised, as it affects the turn radius and turn rate, potentially leading to a localizer overshoot. Additionally, maintaining these speeds provides controllers with more time to manage aircraft on the downwind leg.  

For aircraft conducting a straight-in approach from the initial STAR fix, speed control is generally not required until the aircraft is established on the final approach course, unless necessary for separation.  

However, it is recommended that traffic be instructed to maintain a maximum speed of 180 knots when 10 NM from the landing threshold to ensure approach stabilization criteria are met.  

High speeds may be allowed in the terminal area (TMA) as long as the aircraft is not expected to make turns exceeding 30 degrees of course change in any given arrival segment, and provided the traffic level and controller workload permit.

## 3.3 Descent Profile
### 3.3.1 General
As all **Standard Terminal Arrival Routes (STARs)** are currently **suspended** in the Muscat TMA, arrivals shall be managed using the following vertical separation rule:

- **Departures** shall be assigned **ODD** altitudes or flight levels.  
- **Arrivals** shall be assigned **EVEN** altitudes or flight levels.

Despite the suspension of STARs, aircraft **must continue to comply with altitude constraints** published on approach charts. These include, but are not limited to:

- **Minimum altitudes at Initial Approach Fixes (IAFs)**
- **Altitude restrictions over the Muscat VOR**
- **Any step-down altitudes for ILS, RNP, or VOR approaches**

Controllers shall **not clear aircraft to descend below the applicable Minimum Radar Vectoring Altitude (MRVA)** in the area, in order to maintain safe **obstacle and terrain clearance**.

## 3.4 Lateral Profile
### 3.4.1 General
As all **Standard Terminal Arrival Routes (STARs)** are currently **suspended** in the Muscat TMA, arrivals shall be managed via radar vectors and then given a direct to the IAF as required.

### 3.4.2 Direct Routings
Direct routings within the Muscat TMA shall only be issued when traffic levels permit. When providing a direct routing, controllers must assess and ensure separation from any potential conflicting traffic. Directs shall only be issued to the Initial Approach Fix (IAF).

## 3.5 Final Approach Sequencing
### 3.5.1 Final Descent
Descent to the final approach segment shall be cleared to the published platform altitude for the respective runway, as depicted on the applicable instrument approach chart.

Descent below the platform altitude is generally not recommended. However, it may be permitted if the aircraft remains above the published Minimum Radar Vectoring Altitude (MRVA) for the sector and horizontal separation with other traffic is assured.

## 3.5.2 Final Sequencing
- **Radar separation** shall be maintained at all times in the **base-to-final segment**.  
- When sequencing aircraft, controllers shall give due consideration to:
    - **Wake turbulence categories**,  
    - **Aircraft performance**, and  
    - **Assigned landing runway**.

- **Speed control** shall be applied in accordance with the procedures outlined in **Section 3.2.2**.

- If standard separation cannot be maintained:
    - Aircraft may be instructed to apply **visual separation for wake turbulence**, provided **meteorological conditions permit** and both aircraft are in visual contact.
    - If visual separation is **not possible**, the affected aircraft shall be instructed to **go around** and shall be **re-sequenced** accordingly.

- When vectoring from the downwind leg:
    - A **standard 90-degree base leg** followed by a **30-degree intercept angle to final** shall be used.

## 3.5.3 Longitudinal Separation Requirements
A minimum longitudinal separation of 7 NM shall be applied between arriving aircraft, unless alternate separation has been specifically coordinated with the appropriate AIR controller.

## 3.5.4 Platform Altitudes
