# 4. Air Control Procedures
## 4.1 General provisions
Air Control (AIR) is responsible for all aerodrome movements on runways and their associated taxiways. AIR shall also ensure separation between IFR aircraft that are arriving at and departing the aerodrome, as well as provide traffic information between IFR and VFR aircraft operating within the aerodrome control zone.

## 4.2 Departure procedures
### 4.2.1 Line up clearances
Aircraft that have reached the runway holding points for departure shall be told to line-up once the runway is vacant and there is room to maneuver the aircraft onto the runway.

!!! example
    **Controller:** IGO1515, via T1, line up & wait, runway 29L.

    **Pilot:** Via T1, line up & wait, runway 29L, IGO1515.

Conditional line up instructions must also include the traffic that the aircraft is to follow, as well as the word “behind” at the beginning and end of the transmission. It is suggested to only have a maximum of two conditional line up clearances active at one i.e. one aircraft lining up behind a departure, and another aircraft lining up behind them.

!!! example
    **Controller:** IGO1515, behind the departing Indigo A320, via T1, line up & wait runway 29L, behind.

    **Pilot:** Behind the departing Indigo A320, via T1, line up & wait, runway 29L, IGO1515.

### 4.2.2 Take-off clearances
Aircraft shall be cleared for take-off once adequate separation exists as provided in 4.2.3

!!! example
    **Controler:** IGO1515, (surface) wind 330 degrees, 3 knots, runway 29L, cleared for takeoff.

    **Pilot:** Cleared for takeoff, runway 29L, IGO1515.
    
### 4.2.3 Separation requirements
#### 4.2.3.1 General
Aircraft shall be separated on departure in compliance with standard IFR departure separation minima or enhanced wake turbulence separation (eWTS) requirements.

All aircraft on the same SID shall be separated by a minimum of 2 minutes.

VFR aircraft may be instructed to maintain visual separation with preceding aircraft and given a take-off clearance if no wake turbulence separation minima exists. are able to achieve minimum separation requirements when reaching the respective Fujairah CTA exit point.
### 4.2.4 IFR handoff procedure
IFR departures shall be handed off to Fujrairah Radar.

Where Fujairah Radar is offline, aircraft shall be handed off directly to the appropriate UAE controller.
### 4.2.5 Radar departures
Aircraft on a radar departure shall be instructed to fly a specific heading on departure to increase separation or to clear the departure path for a following aircraft. This departure instruction shall be delivered to the aircraft before issuing the take-off clearance.

The headings to be issued shall be coordinated with departures control.

!!! example
    **Controller:** IGO15C, after departure fly runway heading, maintain altitude 3000ft, wind 280 degrees, 6 knots, runway 29L, cleared for takeoff.

    **Pilot:** After departure fly runway heading, maintain altitude 3000ft, runway 29L, cleared for takeoff, IGO15C.

### 4.2.6 Stopping a departure
Aircraft that have commenced their take-off roll may be instructed to stop immediately to avert a collision due to a runway incursion or any other dangerous situation.

!!! warning
    The instruction to stop must be given early enough such that the aircraft does not reach its decision speed. Therefore, aerodrome controllers must be vigilant and remain aware of the location of traffic and all times as well as runway incursion hotspots. 

!!! example
    **Controller:** IGO15C, Stop immediately, I say again stop immediately, vehicle entering the runway!

For aircraft that have been given a take-off clearance, but have not yet started the roll, they should be instructed to hold position and the take-off clearance must be cancelled along with the reason for cancellation.

!!! example
    **Controller:** IGO15C, hold position, cancel takeoff, I say again cancel takeoff, aircraft entering the runway, acknowledge.

## 4.3 Arrival procedures
### 4.3.1 General
Although the radar controllers are responsible for separating arriving aircraft, the AIR controller shall still ensure that minimum separation is maintained until the preceding aircraft crosses the runway threshold.

### 4.3.2 Speed control

If it is apparent that minimum separation may not exist as provided in Dubai Enhanced Wake Turbulence Separation (eWTS) or minimum radar separation minima, AIR may use a tactical reduction in aircraft speed.

!!! example
    **Controller:** IGO8232, reduce to final approach speed.

### 4.3.3 Visual separation
Aircraft may be instructed to maintain own separation visually, if speed control alone will not resolve the conflict. This shall only be done in VMC and with agreement with the pilot. If no other solutions are practical, the succeeding aircraft shall be instructed to go around.

### 4.3.4 Go around instruction
At any time should a runway become unsuitable for an aircraft landing, or separation minima is not met, aircraft shall be instructed to go-around.

!!! example
    **Controller:** IGO44G, Go around, I say again, go around, acknowledge.

Once aircraft are observed to be safely climbing away, they shall be handed off to departure control.

!!! example
    **Controller:** IGO44G, Climb to 3000ft via standard missed approach, contact Fujairah Radar 129.400.

### 4.3.5 Arrival taxi procedures
Aircraft shall be provided an initial taxi clearance to ensure they are kept moving such that the exit taxiway (RET) is clear for the next arrival and to minimise runway occupancy times.

The initial taxi shall include instructions to taxi “LEFT” or “RIGHT” onto the relevant taxiway as appropriate and hold at a suitable intermediate holding point.

!!! example
    **Controller:** IGO44G, Taxi Right on H, hold short taxiway B.

Once aircraft have been observed to be taxiing and completely clear of the exit, transfer of control shall be initiated to GMC provided there will be no conflicts with other arriving traffic.
## 4.4 VFR procedures
### 4.4.1 VFR departures
Once VFR aircraft are ready for departure, they should be cleared for take-off in sequence. As they begin their crosswind turn (the first turn after departure) they shall be instructed to report leaving the control zone.

Once aircraft are clear of the zone, they shall be instructed to remain outside controlled airspace and monitor advisory.

Aircraft climbing into controlled airspace shall be handed off to departure control.

### 4.4.2 VFR traffic remaining in the circuit
AIR control is responsible for managing circuit traffic. Circuits must always be conducted to the south of the aerodrome for runways 11R/29L

Circuits shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures laid down in 2.5.3

Once aircraft are ready for departure, they should be cleared for take-off in sequence. As they begin their crosswind turn (the first turn after departure) they shall be instructed to report when they are on the downwind with their intentions.

!!! example
    **Controller:** A6-XHB, Report downwind with intentions.

Aircraft may request either a touch and go (where the aircraft lands and immediately takes off), a stop and go (where the aircraft lands, comes to a complete stop on the runway, then takes off), a low approach (where the aircraft flies low over the runway without landing), or a full stop (where the aircraft lands and vacates the runway).

Once AIR is aware of the aircraft’s request, they may be sequenced to the runway, with due consideration given to runway occupancy time.

Aircraft on the downwind should be passed the following information:
 - Expected runway;
 - Sequence; - Traffic information if applicable

!!! example
    **Controller:** A6-XHB, report final runway 29L, number 1, traffic is an A320 on a 3 mile final runway 29L.

### 4.4.3 VFR arrivals
Inbound VFR aircraft shall be instructed to contact AIR with enough time such that two-way radio communications has been established before aircraft enter the aerodrome control zone. On first contact, AIR will pass circuit joining instructions, as well as any other pertinent information.

!!! example
    **Controller:** A6-XHB, Join left-hand downwind runway 29L, 1000ft VFR, QNH 1001
