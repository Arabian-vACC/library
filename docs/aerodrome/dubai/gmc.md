# 4. Ground Movement Procedures
## 4.1 General provisions
The Ground Movement Controller (GMC) is responsible for managing aircraft movements on all aerodrome movement areas except for runways and their associated taxiways. Departing aircraft are given pushback instructions and instructions to taxi to the runway holding point. Arriving aircraft are assigned a stand and instructed to taxi as appropriate.

## 4.2 Pushback procedures
### 4.2.1 General procedure
When aircraft have been handed off to GMC, they shall be fully ready for pushback, and are 5 minutes from their TOBT. Assuming no obstructions, they shall be instructed to push back immediately. If an aircraft is cleared for push and start but does not begin pushing within 2-5 minutes, the pushback clearance is canceled, and a new TOBT is assigned.

Aircraft requesting push that are not squawking their assigned transponder code shall be instructed to hold position and squawk the correct code. They must not be allowed to move until doing so. 

Pushback direction is based primarily on aircraft location and runway configuration. 

All non-A380 traffic on aprons B shall be instructed to push back onto U. All code F (A380/B747-8) traffic on apron B shall be instructed to push back onto taxiway J and face the appropriate direction.

On apron F and A, all traffic shall be instructed to push back onto Z. Pushbacks onto taxiway K shall not be permitted under any circumstances.

A pushback clearance must be a variant of those provided in 4.2.2 and include an instruction to “FACE WEST” or “FACE EAST” as appropriate.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Dubai Ground, UAE4CK, on stand A4 request pushback."

    **Controller**: "UAE4CK, Dubai Ground, pushback approved, face east on Z."

    **Pilot**: "Pushback approved, facing east on Z, UAE4CK."

Conditional pushback instructions may also be issued if an aircraft is taxiing behind another waiting for pushback.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Dubai Ground, FDB647, on stand E8 request pushback."

    **Controller**: "FDB647, Dubai Ground, behind the company 737 passing left to right, pushback approved, face east on P."

    **Pilot**: "After the company 737 passes from left to right, pushback approved, facing east on P, FDB647."

### 4.2.2 Pushback types
#### 4.2.2.1 Standard pushback
This type will normally have the aircraft stop abeam the adjacent stand. The phraseology for this type of pushback is identical to the pushback phraseology as provided in 4.2.1.

#### 4.2.2.2 Short pushback
A short pushback instruction shall require the aircraft to complete the pushback abeam the current stand such that the adjacent stand will not be blocked.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Dubai Ground, UAE51, on stand F6 request pushback."

    **Controller**: "UAE51, Dubai Ground, short pushback approved, face west on Z to finish abeam stand F6."

    **Pilot**: "Short pushback approved, facing west on Z to finish abeam stand F6, UAE51."

#### 4.2.2.3 Long pushback
A long pushback instruction shall require aircraft to complete the pushback operation two stands away from where the pushback was commenced. This manoeuvre may be used when aircraft are vacating a stand to be used by another aircraft that is taxiing in.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Dubai Ground, UAE6LT, on stand A6 request pushback."

    **Controller**: "UAE6LT, Dubai Ground, long pushback approved, face east on Z to finish abeam stand A4."

    **Pilot**: "Long pushback approved, facing east on Z to finish abeam stand A4, UAE6LT."

### 4.2.3 Simultaneous pushback operations
Simultaneous pushbacks may be permitted from adjacent stands provided aircraft are instructed to manoeuvre in accordance with 4.2.2 such that on completion of both aircraft’s pushback operation, they will be separated on the taxiway by two aircraft stands.

### 4.2.4 Dual runway 30R pushback procedures

| **Concourse/Apron**                 | **Standard Instruction Details**                              |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Apron A (except A1, A2 & A10)**   | "FACE EAST" on Z                                              |
| **Stands A1 & A2**                  | "FACE NORTH" on J2                                            |
| **Stand A10**                       | "FACE NORTH" on J3                                            |
| **Apron B *except B27**             | "FACE WEST" on U (J for Code F - see 4.3.2)                   |
| **Stand B27**                       | "FACE NORTH" on J2                                            |
| **Apron C (except C43-50 & C51L)**  | "FACE EAST" on the appropriate taxiway                        |
| **Stand C43-50 and C51L**           | "FACE NORTH" on Z1                                            |
| **Apron D (except D10)**            | "FACE NORTH" on J3                                            |
| **Apron E**                         | "FACE EAST" on P                                              |
| **All other stands**                | Push in the appropriate direction for taxi as provided in 4.3 |

!!! important
    For traffic parked on stand A1, A2 and D1, before issuing pushback instruction, GMC 1 must coordinate the pushback with AIR South to avoid blocking the high speed turn onto taxiway J2.

### 4.2.5 Dual runway 12R pushback procedures
When departing 12R, aircraft south of 12L shall push in the appropriate direction to give the shortest taxi possible to the standard departure point on 12R. 

Aircraft on aprons E and Q shall be instructed to push in the appropriate direction that will allow the shortest taxi time to holding point N2.

### 4.2.6 Single runway pushback procedures
During single runway operations, aircraft shall be pushed back in the most convenient direction to join the appropriate taxi route as provided in 4.3 for the respective runway mode.

## 4.3 Taxi procedures
### 4.3.1 General procedures
Departing aircraft from aprons F, B and D are usually taxied out using the taxiways closest to the concourses (U, W, Y, Z). The only exception to this is code F (A380/B747-8) traffic departing from apron B which must taxi using J and must not be allowed to taxi on U, W or Y.

!!! important
    Where aircraft are taxied to runway holding points, transfer of control to AIR shall be made early enough such that the aircraft is not required to stop its taxi. For traffic taxiing between GMC areas of responsibility, aircraft should be handed off early enough to ensure a non-stop taxi, provided no conflicts are anticipated. 

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Dubai Ground, UAE7TR, request taxi."

    **Controller**: "UAE7TR, Dubai Ground, taxi via Z, L4, M, holding point M13A, runway 30R."

    **Pilot**: "Taxi via Z, L4, M, holding point M13A, runway 30R, UAE7TR."

Several “cross-over” taxiways exist to allow aircraft to transfer between the inner and outer taxiways. These shall be used wherever possible to allow efficient flow of traffic around the airport. 

To deconflict traffic, and to reduce the length of taxi clearances, intermediate holding points shall be used wherever possible.

Intermediate holding points shall always be used when transferring aircraft between controllers to avoid conflicts and the area of responsibility boundaries.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Dubai Ground, UAE9LT, request taxi."

    **Controller**: "UAE9LT, Dubai Ground, taxi via Z, L4, hold L4A."

    **Pilot**: "Taxi via Z, L4, hold L4A, UAE9LT."

Arriving aircraft shall not immediately be handed off by AIR. They must instead be given an initial taxi instruction onto M, N, J2 or K to keep traffic flowing. Therefore, GMC shall assign an arrival stand to aircraft when they are on final approach.

Once the aircraft is handed off to GMC, they may be taxied to their stand. Arrivals shall generally be taxied via the outside taxiways that are farthest away from the stands. 

Aircraft are not required to cross-over to the inside taxiways before initiating the turn onto stand for aprons A, B, D, and F.

### 4.3.2 Taxiway restrictions
Code F aircraft shall not be permitted to taxi on U, Y, W. These taxiways are limited to code E and below.

Code F aircraft shall not be permitted to use the curved portions of J, J1 and J2 if code E aircraft are simultaneously taxiing on the curved portions of U, Y or W and vice versa. 

In this case, traffic shall be instructed to hold short of the curved portion until the adjacent curved taxiway is clear.

Code F aircraft are only permitted to taxi behind on K when code D or smaller aircraft is at the runway holding point at K1, K2, K3, K4, and K5.

Taxiway Q shall be limited to code C and below.

All aircraft taxiing on M or N shall not be permitted to taxi behind aircraft holding at any runway holding point.

No aircraft at K10, K11 and K12 shall be permitted to cross runway 30L/12R until the holding points M13A, M14A and M15 respectively are clear of traffic and vice versa.

!!! important
    These taxiway restrictions must be adhered to to ensure adequate wingtip clearance during taxi.

### 4.3.3 Dual runway 30L/R
#### 4.3.3.1 Departure taxi procedures
When departing from 30R in the dual runway configuration, all aircraft pushing back on apron B and F shall be instructed to taxi via L4 and M.

| **Concourse/Apron** | **Standard Instruction Details**                                                                                                           |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Aprons A, D, G**  | Taxi to holding point K14 for crossing. Z16 shall be used where practical to permit pushback from A9 and A10. Eastbound flow of traffic from Apron A on Z East of J3 should be avoided. |
| **Apron B**         | Traffic on U shall taxi via U, Y, L4 and M. Appropriate use of crossovers is recommended to facilitate continuous pushbacks onto U. Traffic on J shall taxi J, J1 and L3 then right on M. Traffic shall be instructed to hold at holding point M13A and be instructed to monitor AIR North once on M and no conflicts exist. |
| **Apron C**         | Taxi via Z, L1 and M to hold at MC. Coordination is required with GMC 1 to sequence traffic onto M. In all applicable cases, traffic shall be instructed to hold at holding point M13A and be instructed to monitor AIR North once on M and no conflicts exist. |
| **Apron E**         | Taxi via P and a convenient link to join N to holding point N9. Traffic shall be instructed to monitor AIR North once traffic is sequenced, and no other conflicts exist. |
| **Apron F**         | Taxi via Z to L3 then right on M. Prudent use of crossovers to taxiway K is recommended to facilitate continuous pushbacks onto Z. In this case, care should be taken so as not to block K6 which is a rapid exit taxiway. Traffic shall be instructed to hold at holding point M13A and be instructed to monitor AIR North once on M and no conflicts exist. |

!!! important
    Eastbound traffic flow on K shall not be permitted between K1 and K8, as this blocks the rapid exit taxiways from 30L.

    K14 is the standard crossing point for 30L. Other crossing points may only be used after coordination with AIR South

#### 4.3.3.2 Arrival taxi procedures
Aircraft shall vacate 30L onto K9, K8 or K6, depending on the stand assignment described in 4.4.5. After initial taxi is issued by AIR, aircraft are handed off to GMC as provided below. 

| **Concourse/Apron** | **Instruction Details**                                                                                                                    |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Apron A**         | Vacate via K9 or K8 and taxi via K to the appropriate stand. AIR South should issue taxi clearance to the stand to facilitate efficient flow of traffic. Traffic shall be instructed to monitor GMC 1 frequency after taxi clearance has been issued. For aircraft parking on apron A vacating at K8, taxi routings shall be via K eastbound. |
| **Apron B**         | Vacate via K8 or K9 and taxi to J2A. Traffic shall then be transferred to GMC 1. Traffic shall be instructed by GMC1 to taxi right on J to the appropriate stand. |
| **Stand B27**       | Traffic parking on B27 shall be instructed by AIR South to taxi via J right onto Z then left onto W  to hold at WA. Traffic shall then be transferred to GMC 1 for further taxi. |
| **Apron C**         | Vacate at K9, K8 or K6, and taxi via K and hold short at KL and initiate transfer to GMC 1. GMC 1 shall issue taxi via K westbound to hold at KF and transfer control to GMC 2. GMC 2 shall taxi the aircraft to the appropriate stand. |
| **Apron D**         | Vacate via K8 or K9 and taxi to J2A. Traffic shall then be transferred to GMC 1. GMC 1 shall instruct traffic to taxi left on J for the appropriate stand. |
| **Apron E and Q**   | Vacate at K9, K8 or K6, and taxi via K and hold short at KL and initiate transfer to GMC 1. GMC 1 shall instruct traffic to taxi via K, L3 then to holding point M2. Before reaching M2, aircraft shall be transferred to AIR North for runway crossing. After runway crossing, traffic shall be transferred to GMC 2 to taxi to the appropriate stand. |
| **Apron F (except stand F26L and F27)** | Vacate via K9, K8 or K6, and taxi via K and hold short at KL and initiate transfer to GMC 1. GMC 1 shall instruct traffic to taxi via K to the appropriate stand. For stands F16 to F25, AIR South may issue taxi clearance via K to the stand to facilitate efficient flow of traffic. In this case, traffic shall be instructed to monitor GMC 1 frequency after taxi clearance has been issued. |
| **Stand F26L and F27** | Vacate via K8 or K9, taxi right on K then turn left onto W. AIR South should issue taxi clearance via W till the stand to facilitate efficient flow of traffic. In this case, traffic shall be instructed to monitor GMC 1 frequency after taxi clearance has been issued. |

!!!important
    Eastbound traffic flow on K shall not be permitted between K1 and K8, as this blocks the rapid exit taxiways from 30L.

### 4.3.4 Single runway 30R
#### 4.3.4.1 Departure taxi procedures
When departing 30R in the single runway configuration, all aircraft pushing back on apron A, B, D and F shall be instructed to taxi via K4, K7, or K11 and cross 30L as appropriate.

Except for aircraft taxiing from apron C, the section of taxiway M west of K4 shall not be used for departure taxi as this blocks the arrival flow from 30R.

The taxi routes from apron E shall be the same as with the dual runway 30 configuration.

#### 4.3.4.2 Arrival taxi procedures
Aircraft parking on the southern aprons shall vacate to the left and taxi via L3, L4 or M4 to cross 30L.

Aircraft parking on the northern aprons shall vacate right and take the first appropriate turn onto P.

### 4.3.5 Single runway 30L
#### 4.3.5.1 Departure taxi procedures
When departing 30L in the single runway configuration, all aircraft pushing back on aprons A, B, D and F shall taxi via Z until past 30L RETs after which they shall cross onto K and taxi to holding point K17.

!!! important
    Eastbound flow shall not be permitted on K between K1 and K8.

Aircraft on apron E shall cross 30R at N9 and taxi to holding point M20.

#### 4.3.5.2 Arrival taxi procedures
Routings are similar to 30L dual runway taxi, however caution should be exercised for traffic vacating onto J2, as this will cross the departure traffic taxiing eastbound on Z. Appropriate coordination shall be used to mitigate the risk of blocking the high speed exit.

Aircraft are also permitted to vacate right onto M and cross 30R at M10A or M5A.

### 4.3.6 Dual runway 12L/R (Arrival Bias)
#### 4.3.6.1 Departure taxi procedures
Traffic shall taxi to the holding point via the shortest available routing. Use of full-length holding points (K1, K2, M4, M5B) shall require coordination with AIR and shall not be assigned unless requested for performance reasons. These aircraft shall be advised of possible delays due to runway dependency.

Departing traffic shall not be issued taxi to holding points M4, M5B, M7B and M10B, as this interferes with the flow of arrival traffic on M.

Code E and F shall cross behind others at holding point K1, K2, K3, K4 and K5 using Z.

| **Concourse/Apron**                             | **Instruction Details**                                                                                                                    |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Apron A** | Taxi via Z and crossover at Z17 or Z15 as appropriate to taxi via K to holding points K5 or K4. If use of these crossovers is not possible, or practical due to the position of the aircraft after pushback, traffic shall be instructed to cross over at J2. For sequencing, traffic may also be instructed to taxi via Z to holding points K3 or K4. Aircraft shall be transferred to AIR once sequenced and no conflicts exist. |
| **Apron B** | Taxi via U then either Y or W depending on the direction of taxi. Prudent use of crossover taxiways is advised to facilitate continuous pushbacks onto U. These aircraft shall join either J1 or J2 depending on direction of taxi. Traffic via Y and J1 shall taxi via K to holding point K3 or K4 or via Z to holding point K4 or K5. Traffic via W and J2 shall taxi via K to holding point K5 or K4 or via Z to holding point K4 or K3. |
| **Apron C** | Taxi via Z and where possible, use a convenient crossover onto K and hold short of KF. If crossover is not possible, traffic shall hold on Z short of ZE. Traffic shall then be handed over to GMC 1 to taxi to the appropriate runway holding point. GMC 1 shall then hand over traffic to AIR South once sequenced and no conflicts exist. |
| **Apron D** | Taxi via J2 or J1 as appropriate to join K or Z. Taxi routings thereafter shall be the same as Apron A once traffic has joined K or Z. |
| **Apron E and Q** | Taxi via the standard route to holding point N2. Before reaching N2, aircraft are transferred from GMC 2 to AIR North for runway crossing.  After crossing, traffic is handed over to GMC 1. Aircraft then shall taxi via L3, then K to holding point K3, K4 or K5 as appropriate. GMC 1 shall then hand over traffic to AIR South once sequenced and no conflicts exist. |
| **Apron F** |  Taxi via the shortest appropriate route to the standard departure holding points K3, K4 and K5 avoiding conflicts with other departing or arriving traffic. Prudent use of crossover taxiways is advised to facilitate continuous pushbacks onto Z. |

#### 4.3.6.2 Arrival taxi procedures

| **Concourse/Apron**                             | **Instruction Details**                                                                                                                    |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Apron A, B, D, F** | Aircraft parking on the southern aprons shall be instructed by AIR North to vacate via M7A, M9 or M12A and taxi via M to holding points M13B or M14B as appropriate. They shall then be transferred to AIR South for crossing. Once aircraft have crossed 12R, aircraft will be instructed to hold at J3A (for Apron D) or right on K to hold at KR (other aprons). Traffic shall then be transferred to GMC 1. Taxi routes to most aprons on the south side will be via K. For aprons B and D, aircraft shall taxi via J2 and then left or right onto J as appropriate. |
| **Apron C** | AIR North shall instruct traffic to vacate via M7A or M9 and taxi via M westbound and hold at MD. Traffic shall be transferred to GMC 1. GMC 1 shall taxi traffic via L3 or L4 to K and hold at KF. Traffic shall be transferred to GMC 2 for taxi to the appropriate stand. Alternatively, AIR North may transfer traffic to GMC 2 directly. In this case, traffic will taxi via L1 to the appropriate stand. |
| **Apron E and Q** | Aircraft parking on the northern aprons shall vacate 12L onto N6 or N8 and then taxi via N or P as appropriate. A ”bias” mode can be utilised for biasing arrival traffic flow in the Dual runway 12L arrival configuration. In the arrival bias, arriving traffic may vacate 12L to taxi westbound on M and then southbound on L3 and L4 to enter the C apron. Departing traffic will not interfere with the arrivals as they are prohibited from using any of the runway holding points along taxiway M. |

### 4.3.7 Dual runway 12L/R (Departure Bias)
#### 4.3.7.1 Departure taxi procedures
##### Apron E and Q
Taxi routings are similar to the arrival bias mode, except traffic crossing from N2 to M2 is permitted to taxi Eastbound on M, and use departure holding points on M.

##### All other aprons
Taxi routings are the same as the arrival bias mode. Traffic may be crossed over south to north using L4 to make use of departure holding points on M.

#### 4.3.7.2 Arrival taxi procedures
##### Apron C
Taxi routings are similar to the arrival bias mode, except traffic parking on Apron C shall be instructed by AIR North to vacate via N5A, N6 or N8 and taxi left onto N to taxi to N2 for crossing.

Traffic shall then be transferred to GMC 2 for further taxi via M Westbound to L1 to the appropriate stand.

##### All other aprons
Taxi routings are similar to the arrival bias mode.

### 4.3.8 Single runway 12R
#### 4.3.8.1 Departure taxi procedures
Departure taxi routes for 12R single runway operation shall be the same as in dual runway operations, except that aircraft may be assigned full length holding points without restriction.

#### 4.3.8.2 Arrival taxi procedures
Aircraft parking on the southern aprons shall vacate right and taxi in via K.

Aircraft parking on the northern aprons shall vacate left and taxi via M to cross 12L at M10A.

### 4.3.9 Single runway 12L
#### 4.3.9.1 Departure taxi procedures
When operating from 12L during single runway operation, aircraft pushing back on the southern aprons shall taxi westbound to join L3/L4 and then to M1.

Aircraft departing the northern aprons shall taxi to N1.

#### 4.3.9.2 Arrival taxi procedures
Arrival taxi routes during 12L single runway operation shall be the same as 12 dual runway operations.

### 4.3.10 Handoff procedures
When departing traffic has been instructed to taxi to their departure holding points as per the standard taxi routings and when the handoff towards AIR is initiated as per AoR, GMC will ask departing aircraft to monitor the AIR frequency. 

!!! example
    **Controller**: "UAE530, monitor tower 118.750."

When departing traffic has been instructed to taxi to runway holding points for crossing as per the standard taxi routings and when the handoff towards AIR is initiated as per AoR, GMC will ask departing aircraft to contact the AIR frequency.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "UAE8KC, contact tower 119.550."

!!! important
    The key distinction between monitor and contact is as follows: monitor instructs the pilot to switch to the assigned frequency and await a call from the next controller, while contact requires the pilot to switch frequencies and make an initial call. During periods of high traffic, the use of monitor is preferred over contact to reduce radio frequency congestion.

### 4.4.1 Stand allocation procedure
Aircraft shall be assigned stands automatically using Ground Radar Plugin Stand Assigner. If this is not possible, aircraft shall manually be assigned a stand in accordance with the following procedure:

|       Area       |        Stand Allocation       |                                                      Operator                                                     |
|:----------------:|:-----------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Concourse A      | Stands A1 to A10, D1 to D10   | ACA, QFA, UAE, UAL                                                                                                |

### 4.6.2 Handoff procedures
Where transfer of control is to be made between controllers, aircraft shall not be cleared to a point beyond the current controller’s designated zone of responsibility unless there has been prior coordination with the next controller. Intermediate holding points may be used to satisfy this requirement.

### 4.6.3 Splitting procedure
When there is only one GMC online, they shall cover all surface movement areas from the GMC 1 position. 

Unless otherwise authorised by the Arabian vACC staff, GMP (Dubai Delivery) must be online before two GMC (Dubai Ground) positions are be opened.

When GMP is not online, GMC shall assume the responsibility of the lower controller.
