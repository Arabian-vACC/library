# 2. Departure Clearance Procedures
## 2.1 General provisions
AIR Controller (AIR) is responsible for validating routes and shall provide VFR clearance to departing aircraft. The controller shall assign the correct departure procedure to the aircraft based on the first point that is filed on the flight plan.
## 2.2 VFR aircraft
VFR flight activity should be planned in accordance to published VFR charts, specifically the “Delma CTR VFR” chart for VFR traffic navigating out of the Delma CTR into neighbouring airspaces and within the Delma control zone. AIR may use the appropriate charts as per the requirements of the pilot’s intentions.

At any time, AIR control and Approach/Departure control may impose partial or full restrictions to VFR operations out of OMDL during periods of increased IFR activity or due to restrictions and limitations to aircraft type. It is imperative that AIR is in continuous coordination with Approach/Departure control for departing VFR traffic.

### 2.2.1 VFR departures into uncontrolled airspace
VFR traffic shall be cleared via the most appropriate VFR route towards their destination. If necessary, the clearance may be amended by AIR prior to departure.

All VFR departures shall be assigned a discrete SSR code so that they may be identified on radar.
### 2.2.2 VFR departures into controlled airspace
VFR aircraft requesting clearance to climb into approach airspace shall only be cleared after prior coordination with approach/departure control. Otherwise, they shall be instructed to remain outside controlled airspace after leaving the control zone.

All VFR departures shall be assigned a discrete SSR code so that they may be identified on radar.

!!! example
  **Pilot**: "Delma, A6-CTK, type Dash 8, stand 2, Information A,  request eastbound departure on track Abu Dhabi, altitude 6500ft.."
    
  **ATC**: "A6-CTK, Delma Tower, cleared eastbound departure, altitude 6500ft VFR, Runway 35, Squawk 0657."
    
  **Pilot**: "Cleared eastbound departure, altitude 6500ft VFR, Runway 35, Squawk 0657, A6-CTK."

  **ATC**: A6-CTK, readback correct, information A, QNH 1003, Report ready for start-up."

### 2.2.3 VFR traffic remaining in circuit
All VFR aircraft shall be instructed to conduct circuits to the north of the aerodrome right-hand circuits for 35 and left-hand circuits for 17 (in accordance with section 4.3.3) at an altitude of 1500ft for jet traffic, 1000ft for Turbo-props, 500ft for Helicopters.
