# 4. Air Control Procedures
## 4.1 General provisions
Air Control (AIR) is responsible for all aerodrome movements on runways and their associated taxiways. AIR shall also ensure to provide traffic information between VFR and VFR aircraft operating within the aerodrome control zone.

## 4.2 VFR procedures
### 4.2.1 Line up and Backtrack clearances
Aircraft that have reached the runway holding points for departure shall be told to backtrack line-up once the runway is vacant and there is room to maneuver the aircraft onto the runway.

!!! example
    **Controller**: A6-CTV, Backtrack line up runway 35.  

Conditional line up instructions must also include the traffic that the aircraft is to follow, as well as the word “behind” at the beginning and end of the transmission. It is suggested to only have a maximum of two conditional line up clearances active at one i.e. one aircraft lining up behind a departure, and another aircraft lining up behind them.

!!! example
    **Controller**: A6-CTV, Behind the departing Cessna 172, Backtrack line up runway 35 behind.
    **Pilot**: Behind the departing Cessna 172, backtrack line up runway 35, behind A6-CTV.

### 4.3.2 VFR departures
Once VFR aircraft are ready for departure, they should be cleared for take-off in sequence. As they begin their crosswind turn (the first turn after departure) they shall be instructed to report leaving the control zone.

Once aircraft are clear of the zone, they shall be instructed to remain outside controlled airspace and monitor advisory.

Aircraft climbing into controlled airspace shall be handed off to departure control.

!!! example
    **Controller**: A6-CTV, (surface) wind 330 degrees, 7 knots, runway 35, cleared for takeoff.
    **Pilot**: Cleared for takeoff, runway 30, A6-CTV

### 4.3.3 VFR traffic remaining in the circuit
AIR control is responsible for managing circuit traffic. Circuits must always be conducted to the south of the aerodrome for runways 35/17 and to the north of the aerodrome for runways 35/17

Circuits shall be conducted to operate Left Hand circuits for runway 17, and Right Hand circuits for runway 35

Once aircraft are ready for departure, they should be cleared for take-off in sequence. As they begin their crosswind turn (the first turn after departure) they shall be instructed to report when they are on the downwind with their intentions.

!!! example
    **Controller**: A6-CTV, Report downwind with intentions.

Aircraft may request either a touch and go (where the aircraft lands and immediately takes off), a stop and go (where the aircraft lands, comes to a complete stop on the runway, then takes off), a low approach (where the aircraft flies low over the runway without landing), or a full stop (where the aircraft lands and vacates the runway).

Once AIR is aware of the aircraft’s request, they may be sequenced to the runway, with due consideration given to runway occupancy time.

Aircraft on the downwind should be passed the following information: - Expected runway; - Sequence; - Traffic information if applicable

!!! example
    **Controller**: A6-CTV, report final runway 35, number 1, traffic is a Cessna 172 on a 2 mile final runway 35.


### 4.3.4 VFR arrivals
Inbound VFR aircraft shall be instructed to contact AIR with enough time such that two-way radio communications has been established before aircraft enter the aerodrome control zone. On first contact, AIR will pass circuit joining instructions, as well as any other pertinent information.

!!! example
    **Controller**: A6-CTV, Delma Tower, join left hand downwind runway 17, 1000ft VFR, QNH 1015.

VFR arrivals may be denied entry into the control zone during times of increased IFR arrival activity and instructed to hold outside controller airspace awaiting further instructions.
