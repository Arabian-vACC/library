# 3. Ground Movement Control ("Ras Al Khaimah Ground")


## 3.1 General provisions
GMC is also responsible for managing aircraft movements on all aerodrome movement areas except for runways and their associated taxiways. Departing aircraft are given pushback instructions and instructions to taxi to the runway holding point. Arriving aircraft are assigned a stand and instructed to taxi as appropriate.

## 3.2 Departure pushback procedures

### 3.2.1 General pushback procedures
Assuming no obstructions, aircraft shall be instructed to pushback immediately.

Aircraft requesting pushback that are not squawking their assigned transponder code shall be instructed to hold position and squawk the correct code; movement of such aircraft is prohibited.

!!! example
      **Controller:** AXB332, Ras Al Khaimah Ground, pushback approved, facing north.

      **Pilot:** Pushback approved, facing north, AXB332.

!!! note
      Conditional pushback instructions may also be issued if an aircraft is taxiing behind another waiting for pushback.

!!! example
      **Controler:** IGO1494, Ras Al Khaimah Ground, behind the Air India Boeing 737, passing right to left, pushback approved, facing south, behind.

      **Pilot:** Behind the Air India Boeing 737, passing right to left, pushback approved, facing south, behind, IGO1494.

### 3.2.2 Pushback types
#### 3.2.2.1 Standard pushback
This type will normally have the aircraft stop abeam the adjacent stand. The phraseology for this type of pushback is identical to the pushback phraseology as provided in 3.2.1.

#### 3.2.2.2 Short pushback
A short pushback instruction shall require the aircraft to complete the pushback abeam the current stand such that the adjacent stand will not be blocked.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Ras Al Khaimah , ABY868, on stand 4 request pushback."

    **Controller**: "ABY868, Ras Al Khaimah Ground, short pushback approved, face South on S1 to finish abeam stand 5."

    **Pilot**: "Short pushback approved, facing west on S1 to finish abeam stand 5, ABY868."

### 3.2.3 Long pushback 
A long pushback instruction shall require aircraft to complete the pushback operation two stands away from where the pushback was commenced. This manoeuvre may be used when aircraft are vacating a stand to be used by another aircraft that is taxiing in.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Ras Al Khaimah Ground, IGO1246, on stand 7 request pushback."

    **Controller**: "IGO1246, Ras Al Khaimah Ground, long pushback approved, face South on N1 to finish abeam stand 11."

    **Pilot**: "Long pushback approved, facing South on N1 to finish abeam stand 11,IGO1246 ."

### 3.2.4 Simultaneous pushback procedure
Simultaneous pushback operations shall be permitted so long as aircraft are separated by at least 2 stands upon completion of their pushback.

### 3.2.5 GMC positions
GMC is responsible for all aprons and associated taxiways.

### 3.3.6 Handoff procedures
Where transfer of control is to be made between controllers, aircraft shall not be cleared to a point beyond the current controllerâ€™s designated zone of responsibility unless there has been prior coordination with the next controller. Intermediate holding points may be used to satisfy this requirement.
