# 2. Departure Clearance Procedures
## 2.1 General provisions
Airways clearance/Ground Movement Planner (GMP) is responsible for validating routes and shall provide IFR clearance to departing aircraft. The controller shall assign the correct departure procedure to the aircraft based on the first point that is filed on the flight plan.

Where the flight plan contains an invalid route, level, or departure procedure, GMP must ensure that the error is corrected before the aircraft is given its clearance.

GMP is also responsible for minimizing taxiway delays and taxiway congestion for departing aircraft. During times of increased departure activity, aircraft are held at the gate to save fuel and lessen taxiway congestion.

## 2.2 Departure clearance
### 2.2.1 General
GMP is responsible for issuing clearances for departing aircraft. Pilots may be expected to report the following information on first contact:

- Callsign
- Aircraft type
- Parking Stand
- Destination
- Speed if unable to comply with minimum speed on the SID
- ATIS letter & QNH

### 2.2.2 Information contained in a departure clearance
- Callsign
- Destination
- Departure procedure
- Initially cleared altitude
- Assigned SSR code

GMC shall obtain a full readback of the clearance. If the pilot does not report the current ATIS letter on first contact, GMC shall pass the current ATIS letter and QNH.

Departing aircraft shall be instructed to remain on the frequency and report ready to push

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Ras Al Khaimah Ground, good evening, ABY868, Airbus A320, stand 2, requesting IFR clearance to Islamabad, exiting the Ras Al Khaimah control zone at ASNEK"
    
    **Controller**: "ABY868, cleared to Islamabad via the ASNE1N departure, maintain altitude 6000ft, squawk 0542."
    
    **Pilot**: "Cleared to Islamabad, ASNE1N departure, maintain altitude 6000ft, squawk 0542, ABY868."

    **Controller**: "ABY868, readback correct, information Bravo, QNH 1002, report ready for pushback."

### 2.2.3 Aircraft requiring a reroute
Aircraft requiring a reroute shall be given a voice clearance on frequency.

### 2.2.4 Voice clearance
Aircraft requesting clearance via voice shall be given a voice clearance as per the format in 2.2.2

## 2.3 Departure Procedures
### 2.3.1 RNAV Standard instrument departures
Ras Al Khaimah primarily uses RNAV standard instrument departures (SIDs) and is the preferred departure type for IFR aircraft. Departing aircraft shall be assigned an appropriate RNAV departure according to the first fix in the flight plan and runway in use.

Departures on all SID's apart from PUVAL shall be assigned an initial climb of 6000ft. Departures on PUVAL SID's shall be assigned an initial climb of 3000ft

| First Fix | 34      | 16      |
|:---------:|:-------:|:-------:|
|   ASNEK   |    1N   |    1E/W |
|   EMOPI   |    2E/W |    2S   |
|   PUVAL   |    1N   |   1S    |


### 2.3.2 Radar departures
The radar departure procedure shall be used when aircraft are unable to accept an RNAV departure, such as one with outdated nav data. Whereas RNAV departures follow a prescribed track, radar departures are given radar vectors to the first fix.

In the take-off clearance, Air Control (AIR) shall assign a heading to fly after departure appropriate to the Dubai CTA exit point.

A radar departure clearance shall contain the following information:

- Callsign;
- Destination;
- Departure instructions;
- Initially cleared altitude;
- Frequency handoff;
- Assigned SSR code

!!! note
      Aircraft on a radar departure shall have the text *VECTORS* inserted to the scratchpad section of their entry on the departure list.

## 2.4 Rerouting aircraft

!!! example
    **Controller**: "IGO1494, cleared to Cochin, via PUVA1N, PUVAL RUKOR L223 TARDI N629 GIDAN P570 TOLDA, flight planned route. Maintain 3000ft, squawk 0532."


## 2.5 Requested cruising level
### 2.5.1 Level restrictions
!!!info 
      Should an aircraft file an invalid cruise level, GMC shall advise the aircraft of this when delivering the clearance. In **all** cases, the next lowest valid cruise level should be assigned and the aircraft advised.

!!!note
      Offering two valid levels (one above and below their requested level) is discouraged; a lower level than what is requested can be complied with certainty factoring the aircraft's maximum capable cruise level as per their gross weight. On the other hand, higher levels may be rejected due to aircraft performance or maximum cruise altitude capabilities.

      Thus, resorting to issuing the next lowest valid cruise level minimises radio transmissions and simplifies the correction process between the controller and the aircraft.
      

## 2.5 Runway change procedure
Runway change shall be coordinated with Ras Al Khaimah AIR

## 2.6 VFR aircraft
VFR flight activity should be planned in accordance to published VFR charts, specifically the “UAE NORTHEN EMIRATES VFR” chart for VFR traffic navigating out of the Ras Al Khaimah control zone into neighbouring airspaces and within the Ras Al Khaimah control zone. GMC may use the appropriate charts as per the requirements of the pilot’s intentions.


### 2.6.1 VFR departures into uncontrolled airspace
VFR traffic shall be cleared via the most appropriate VFR route towards their destination. If necessary, the clearance may be amended by AIR prior to departure.

All VFR departures shall be assigned a discrete SSR code so that they may be identified on radar.

### 2.6.2 VFR departures into controlled airspace
VFR aircraft requesting clearance to climb into approach airspace (above 1500 ft) shall only be cleared after prior coordination with approach/departure control. Otherwise, they shall be instructed to remain outside controlled airspace after leaving the control zone.

All VFR departures shall be assigned a discrete SSR code so that they may be identified on radar.

!!! example
      **Pilot:** Ras Al Khaimah Ground, A6-CTK, DA40 , request south-eastbound departure on track Fujeirah, altitude 5500ft.

      **Controller:** A6-CTK, Ras Al Khaimah Ground, cleared eastbound departure, altitude 5500ft VFR, Runway 34, Squawk 0646.

      **Pilot:** Cleared eastbound departure, altitude 5500ft VFR, Runway 34, Squawk 0646, A6-CTK.

      **Controller:** A6-CTK, readback correct, information T, QNH 1001, Report ready for start-up.

### 2.6.3 VFR traffic remaining in circuit
VFR traffic wishing to remain in the circuit shall be cleared only after prior coordination with AIR and Approach/Departure control. All VFR circuit traffic shall be assigned a discrete SSR code so that they may be identified on radar.

VFR traffic will be instructed to conduct Left hand circuit's off RWY 34 and Right hand circuits's off RWY 16. Both ciruits shall be conducted at 1500ft
