# 3. Ground Movement Procedures
## 3.1 General provisions
The Ground Movement Controller (GMC) is responsible for managing aircraft movements on all aerodrome movement areas except for runways and their associated taxiways. Departing aircraft are given pushback instructions and instructions to taxi to the runway holding point. Arriving aircraft are assigned a stand and instructed to taxi as appropriate.

## 3.2 Departure pushback procedures
### 3.2.1 General procedure
When aircraft contact GMC for push, they should be fully ready for pushback, and 5 minutes from their TOBT. Assuming no obstructions, they shall be instructed to push back immediately. If an aircraft is cleared for push and start but does not begin pushing within 2-5 minutes, the pushback clearance is cancelled, and a new TOBT is assigned.

Aircraft requesting push that are not squawking their assigned transponder code shall be instructed to hold position and squawk the correct code. They must not be allowed to move until doing so. 

Pushback direction is based primarily on aircraft location and runway configuration. 

A pushback clearance must be a variant of those provided in 3.2.2 and include an instruction to “FACE NORTH” or “FACE SOUTH” as appropriate.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Al-Ain Ground, UAE4CK, on stand 7 request pushback."

    **Controller**: "UAE4CK, Al-Ain Ground, pushback approved, face North."

    **Pilot**: "Pushback approved, face North."

Conditional pushback instructions may also be issued if an aircraft is taxiing behind another waiting for pushback.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Al-Ain Ground, PIA647, on stand 8 request pushback."

    **Controller**: "PIA647, Al-Ain Ground, behind the company 737 passing left to right, pushback approved, face North."

    **Pilot**: "After the company 737 passes from left to right, pushback approved, facing North, PIA647."


### 3.2.2 Simultaneous pushback operations
Simultaneous pushbacks may be permitted from adjacent stands provided aircraft are instructed to manoeuvre in accordance with 3.2.1 such that on completion of both aircraft’s pushback operation, they will be separated on the taxiway by two aircraft stands.

### 3.2.3 GMC positions
GMC is responsible for all aprons and associated taxiways.

### 3.2.4 Handoff procedures
Where transfer of control is to be made between controllers, aircraft shall not be cleared to a point beyond the current controller’s designated zone of responsibility unless there has been prior coordination with the next controller. Intermediate holding points may be used to satisfy this requirement.

### 3.2.5 Taxi Restrictions
Code F aircraft shall only use taxiways A, E, F, L, M, and O. All Code F aircraft shall vacate the runway via taxiways A and E only.
