# 9. Appendix - Temporary Procedures
## 9.1 General Provisions
This document is intended to supplement the standard operating procedures for the temproary periods detailed within during extended closure periods.

## 9.2 16L/34R Runway Remediation
The runway remediation plan for 16L/34R will take place commencing **07 NOV 2025** and will be split in to three phases, running up to **13 JUN 2026**. 

|  Phase  | Start Date        | End Date          | Summary                                                |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Phase 1 | 07 NOV 2025 1601z | 14 JAN 2026 2359z | Works between A and A2. RWY 16L/34R will operate with reduced length as a non precision runway |
| Phase 2 | 15 JAN 2026 0000z | 12 APR 2026 2359z | Works between A9 and A12. RWY 16L/34R will operate with reduced length as a non precision runway |
| Phase 3 | 13 APR 2026 0000z | 13 JUN 2026 2359z | Full closure of RWY 16L/34R |

These phases are detailed below along with adjusted SOP relating to the operation of 16L/34R

### 9.2.1 Phase 1
The length of RWY 16L/34R will be reduced to 4270m. The vast majority of aircraft on normal operations will be able to depart using this runway length.

**34R Operations:** A2 becomes "full length" for departures, with A3 available as an intersection at the controller's discretion. Temporary arrival procedure RNP T 34R is available and can be found in the AIP Supplement and on Navigraph charts.

**16L Operations:** The last point at which an aircraft can vacate is A2. Intersections available as normal.

### 9.2.2 Phase 2
The length of RWY 16L/34R will be reduced to 3030m. The majority of aircraft should still be able to depart from this runway length, however in the event that they are unable, 16R/34L should be used as the alternative.

### 9.2.3 Phase 3
RWY 16L/34R will be closed for an extended period, with all departures/arivvals utilising RWY 16L/34R.

## 9.3 Revised Procedures
### 9.3.1 Phase 1
#### 9.3.1.1 Arriving Aircraft
When arriving 34R, pilots shall expect the temporary RNP T 34R approach which accommodates the displaced threshold. This procedure is active from 07 NOV 2025 0000z until 18 MAR 2026 2359z.

The standard vacate point for RWY 34R has been amended to A9 as part of this procedure.

#### 9.3.1.2 Departing Aircraft - 34R
Departing traffic shall be instructed to hold short taxiway A2 on either B or C and GMC should hand off traffic at the earliest opportunity to AIR to allow for appropriate sequencing to take place. Pilots not able to accept A2 for departure should be reassigned to RWY 34L for departure (refer to **3.3.2 RNP Radar Departures** where appropriate).

#### 9.3.1.3 Departing Aircraft - 16L
Traffic cleared from 16L shall be provided with their SID as normal, but additionally shall be provided with an instruction **"Passing 500 ft, turn left heading 120 degrees, climb to altitude 4000 ft."**

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Hamad Clearance Delivery, QTR1Y, Boeing 777-300ER, information A, stand C10, requesting FL210, to Dubai."

    **Controller**: "QTR1Y, Hamad Clearance Delivery, information A correct, cleared to Dubai via the ALSEM2M departure, passing 500 ft, turn left heading 120 degrees, climb to altitude 4000ft, squawk 0550."

    **Pilot**: "Cleared to Dubai via the ALSEM2M departure, passing 500 ft, turn left heading 120 degrees, climb to altitude 4000ft, squawk 0550, QTR1Y."

    **Controller**: "QTR1Y, readback correct, QNH 1012, report ready for pushback."

When handed off to the relevant departure frequency, the appropriate controller will provide vectors to rejoin the SID.

#### 9.3.1.3 ATIS Configuration
The ATIS profile will be updated to reflect the changes in the 34R approach for all configurations.
