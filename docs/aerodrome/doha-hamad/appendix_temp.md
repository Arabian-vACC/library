# 9. Appendix - Temporary Procedures
## 9.1 General Provisions
This document is intended to supplement the standard operating procedures for the temproary periods detailed within during extended closure periods.

## 9.2 16L/34R Runway Remediation
The runway remediation plan for 16L/34R will take place commencing **01 NOV 2025** and will be split in to three phases, running up to **13 JUN 2026**. 

|  Phase  | Start Date        | End Date          | Summary                                                |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Phase 1 | 07 NOV 2025 1601z | 14 JAN 2026 2359z | Works between A and A2. RWY 16L/34R will operate with reduced length as a non precision runway |
| Phase 2 | 15 JAN 2026 0000z | 12 APR 2026 2359z | Works between A9 and A12. RWY 16L/34R will operate with reduced length as a non precision runway |
| Phase 3 | 13 APR 2026 0000z | 13 JUN 2026 2359z | Full closure of RWY 16L/34R |

These phases are detailed below along with adjusted SOP relating to the operation of 16L/34R

### 9.2.1 Phase 1
The length of RWY 16L/34R will be reduced to 4270m. The vast majority of aircraft on normal operations will be able to depart using this runway length.

**34R Operations:** A2 becomes "full length" for departures, with A3 available as an intersection at the controller's discretion. Temporary arrival procedure RNP T 34R is available and can be found in the AIP Supplement and on Navigraph charts.

**16L Operations:** The last point at which an aircraft can vacate is A2. Intersections available as normal.

### 9.2.2 Phase 2
The length of RWY 16L/34R will be reduced to 3030m. The majority of aircraft should still be able to depart from this runway length, however in the event that they are unable, 16R/34L should be used as the alternative.

### 9.2.3 Phase 3
RWY 16L/34R will be closed for an extended period, with all departures/arivvals utilising RWY 16L/34R.

## 9.3 Revised Procedures
### 9.3.1 Phase 1
#### 9.3.1.1 Arriving Aircraft
When arriving 34R, pilots can expect the temporary RNP T 34R approach which accommodates the displaced threshold. This procedure is active from 01 NOV 2025 0000z until 18 MAR 2026 2359z.

#### 9.3.1.2 Departing Aircraft
Departing traffic will be instructed to hold short taxiway A2 on either B or C and GMC should hand off traffic at the earliest opportunity to AIR to allow for appropriate sequencing to take place.
