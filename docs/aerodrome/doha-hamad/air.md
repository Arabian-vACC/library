# 4. Air Control ("Hamad Tower")
## 4.1 General provisions
Air Control (AIR) is responsible for all aerodrome movements on runways and their associated taxiways. AIR shall also ensure separation between IFR aircraft that are arriving at and departing the aerodrome, as well as provide traffic information to VFR aircraft operating within the aerodrome control zone.

## 4.2 Preferential runways
At Doha-Hamad, parallel runways are used at the same time for both departures and arrivals. 

- **Simultaneous Parallel Departures (SPD):** Departures can happen simultaneously on any of the three parallel runways.  
- **Simultaneous Parallel Approaches (SPA):** Arrivals can be managed as either Dependent or Independent Parallel Approaches, depending on traffic flow or the operational mode.

The preferred calm wind configuration is using runways 34L and 34R, which may be utilized with a tailwind of up to 5 knots. If this configuration is not feasible due to wind conditions or other factors, runways 16L and 16R shall be used instead.

### 4.2.1 Dependent parallel runway approaches (DPA)
Dependent Parallel Approaches (DPA) involve simultaneous approaches to parallel or nearly parallel runways with required radar separation between aircraft on adjacent centerlines. During DPA operations:

- A 1.5 NM diagonal stagger is required for inbound aircraft to Doha-Hamad.
- A 2.0 NM diagonal stagger is required for inbound aircraft to Doha Hamad and Doha.
- Pilots will be notified of DPA operations through the ATIS.

### 4.2.2 Independent parallel runway approaches (IPA)
Independent Parallel Approaches (IPA) involve simultaneous approaches to parallel or nearly parallel runways, where radar separation between aircraft on adjacent centerlines is not required. During IPA operations:

- Pilots will be notified of IPA operations through the ATIS.
- After receiving ILS clearance, pilots must maintain specific altitudes until established on the glidepath: 2500 FT for runway 16L/34R and 3500 FT for runway 16R/34L. Early descent below the glidepath to the final approach altitude is not allowed unless directed by ATC.
- For RWY 16L/34R (low side), the base turn will be instructed by ATC once the aircraft is maintaining the final intercept altitude of 2500 FT.

### 4.2.3 No transgression zone (NTZ)
In the context of independent parallel approaches, there is a defined airspace corridor located centrally between the two extended runway centerlines. If an aircraft enters this corridor, air traffic control (ATC) must intervene to maneuver any nearby aircraft on the adjacent approach.

#### 4.2.3.1 Break-out manouver
If an aircraft infringes the NTZ, the Final Approach Monitoring Controller will issue a breakout instruction to the aircraft under their responsibility to protect it from the threat. Breakout maneuvers include heading and altitude instructions.

The Final Approach Monitoring Controller will override the relevant Tower frequency when issuing a breakout maneuver due to an NTZ infringement from the adjacent approach path.

## 4.3 Departure procedures
High Intensity Runway Operations for departing aircraft are in effect 24 hours a day. All checks should be completed when reaching the assigned holding point, and aircraft must line up without delay when cleared by ATC. Prompt action should be taken in response to take-off clearance. Whenever possible, intersection departures should be used.

### 4.3.1 Standard departure points

| Runway | Standard departure points |
|:------:|:-------------------------:|
|   16L  |            A10            |
|   16R  |        L10/M11/M12        |
|   34L  |          L2/M3/M4         |
|   34R  |             A2            |
<figure markdown>
  <figcaption>Table 4-1: Standard departure points</figcaption>
</figure>

### 4.3.2 Line up clearances
Conditional line up instructions shall include the traffic that the aircraft is to follow, as well as the word “behind” at the beginning and end of the transmission. It is recommended to only have a maximum of two conditional line up clearances active at one i.e., one aircraft lining up behind a departure, and another aircraft lining up behind them.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "QTR40P, behind the departing company Airbus A350, via A2, line up and wait runway 34R behind."

If aircraft have not yet reached the holding point where they are expected to line up at, ATC shall reiterate the cleared holding point.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "QTR40P, via A2, line up and wait runway 34R."

### 4.3.3 Take-off clearances
Aircraft will be cleared for takeoff once adequate separation is ensured as outlined in sections 4.3.4 and 4.6. At the time of takeoff clearance, aircraft will be assigned their airborne frequency, either for Doha Approach East or West, or the next available station, such as Doha Radar or Doha Control. If none of these stations are online, aircraft will be instructed to monitor UNICOM 122.8.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "QTR40P, airborne contact Doha Approach East 124.775, wind 330 degrees 7 knots, runway 34R, cleared for take-off."

### 4.3.4 Separation requirements
#### 4.3.4.1 General
Aircraft shall be separated on departure in compliance with standard IFR departure separation minima, recategorisation wake turbulence separation minima (RECAT) requirements or as provided in 4.6 where applicable.

Except as provided in 4.3.4.2, succeeding aircraft on the same SID shall be separated by a minimum of **2 minutes**.

#### 4.3.4.3 Low visibility and IMC
During low visibility operations and during IMC, departing aircraft shall not be cleared for take-off when there is an arriving aircraft within **4 NM** of the landing runway threshold.

### 4.3.5 IFR handoff procedure
#### 4.3.5.1 General
IFR departures will receive their handoff instructions as part of the takeoff clearance, as outlined in section 4.3.3. Aircraft that do not receive handoff instructions in their takeoff clearance will be handed off when passing 1000 feet, allowing sufficient time for a frequency change and preventing a level-off during departure.

Controllers should refer to section 4.3.5.2 for the appropriate Doha Approach handoff procedures.

Aircraft performing a go-around on runway 16L/34R will be handed off to Doha Approach East on 124.775, while aircraft going around on runway 16R/34L will be handed off to Doha Approach West on 119.725.

If Doha Approach (East or West) is offline, all handoffs will be directed to Doha Radar. If Doha Radar (North or South) is also offline, all handoffs will be directed to Doha Control.

#### 4.3.5.2 Doha Approach hand off procedure
| Runway |      Hand off      |
|:------:|:------------------:|
|   16L  | Doha Approach East |
|   16R  | Doha Approach West |
|   34L  | Doha Approach West |
|   34R  | Doha Approach East |
<figure markdown>
  <figcaption>Table 4-2: Doha Approach hand offs</figcaption>

### 4.3.6 Stopping a departure
Aircraft that have commenced their take-off roll may be instructed to stop immediately to avert a collision due to a runway incursion or any other dangerous situation. 

It must be noted though, that the instruction to stop must be given early enough such that the aircraft does not reach its decision speed. Therefore, aerodrome controllers must be vigilant and remain aware of the location of traffic at all times as well as runway incursion hotspots.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "IBE392, stop immediately, I say again stop immediately, truck entering the runway!"

For aircraft that have been given a take-off clearance, but have not yet started the roll, they shall be instructed to hold position and the take-off clearance must be cancelled along with the reason for cancellation.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "IBE392, hold position, cancel take-off, I say again cancel take-off, aircraft entering the runway, acknowledge."

## 4.4 Arrival Procedures
### 4.4.1 Standard runway exits
On initial contact, aircraft shall be instructed to vacate at a designated taxiway for arrival. The planned exit point shall be one of the preferred exit taxiways (Table 5-2).

| Runway | Runway Exit |
|:------:|:-----------:|
|   16L  |      A7     |
|   16R  |    L5/M7    |
|   34L  |    L6/M8    |
|   34R  |      A5     |
<figure markdown>
  <figcaption>Table 4-3: Standard runway exits</figcaption>
</figure>

### 4.4.2 Separation requirements
#### 4.4.2.1 General
While the radar controllers are responsible for separating arriving aircraft, the AIR controller shall still ensure that minimum separation is maintained until the preceding aircraft crosses the runway threshold. 

#### 4.4.2.2 Speed control
If it is apparent that minimum separation may not exist as provided in 4.4.2.1, AIR may use a tactical reduction in aircraft speed.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "QTR36M, reduce to final approach speed."

#### 4.4.2.3 Visual separation
Aircraft may be instructed to maintain own separation visually, if speed control alone will not resolve the conflict. This shall only be done in VMC and with agreement with the pilot. If no other solutions are practical, the succeeding aircraft shall be instructed to go around.

### 4.4.3 Go-around instruction
#### 4.4.3.1 General go-around procedure
At any time should a runway become unsuitable for an aircraft landing, or separation minima is not met, aircraft shall be instructed to go-around.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "QTR36M, go around, I say again, go around, acknowledge."

Once aircraft have acknowledged the instruction and are observed to be safely climbing away, they shall be handed off to the appropriate Doha Approach controller.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "QTR36M, climb to 4000ft via standard missed approach, contact Doha Approach East 124.775."

#### 4.4.3.2 Go-around with simultaneous departure in IMC or during LVO
Aircraft shall be instructed to follow the standard missed approach and aircraft shall not be permitted to depart if an arriving aircraft is within **4 NM** of the landing threshold.

### 4.4.4 Arrival taxi procedures
In accordance with the taxi procedures laid down in 3.4, aircraft shall be provided an initial taxi clearance to ensure they are kept moving such that the rapid exit taxiway (RET) is clear for the next arrival.

The initial taxi shall include instructions to taxi “LEFT” or “RIGHT” onto the relevant taxiway as appropriate and hold at a suitable intermediate holding point.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "QTR9L taxi right onto K, hold short R."

Once aircraft have been observed to be taxiing and completely clear of the RET, transfer of control shall be initiated to GMC provided there will be no conflicts with other arriving traffic.

## 4.5 Reduced runway separation minima (RRSM)
### 4.5.1 Conditions for the application of RRSM
- The tailwind component must not exceed 5 knots, measured at the landing threshold, and there should be no pilot reports of wind shear.
- Meteorological visibility must be at least 5 km, with a cloud ceiling no lower than 1000 feet. ATC must be confident that the pilot of the following aircraft can clearly and continuously observe the relevant traffic.
- The pilot of the succeeding aircraft must be warned, and traffic information must be provided to them.
- The runway must be dry, with no signs that braking action could be negatively affected.
- ATC must be able to assess separation visually, and wake turbulence separation minima must be applied.
- Minimum separation must be maintained between two departing aircraft immediately after the second aircraft takes off.
- To ensure the preceding aircraft vacates the runway in a timely manner, the pilot should be advised of the exit at which they should plan to vacate.

### 4.5.2 Departure following departure
Take-off clearance may be issued to a departing aircraft, commencing its take-off roll from full length, before the preceding departure has passed the upwind end of the runway, provided that ATC has reasonable assurance that:

- **RWY 16L:**  
  The preceding aircraft will be airborne and have passed a point at least 2400 meters from the threshold (abeam TWY A5) by the time the succeeding aircraft begins its take-off roll. Minimum separation will continue to exist, constant or increasing, between the two departing aircraft immediately after the second aircraft's take-off.

- **RWY 34R:**  
  The preceding aircraft will be airborne and have passed a point at least 2400 meters from the threshold (abeam TWY A7) by the time the succeeding aircraft begins its take-off roll. Minimum separation will continue to exist, constant or increasing, between the two departing aircraft immediately after the second aircraft's take-off.

- **RWY 16R:**  
  The preceding aircraft will be airborne and have passed a point at least 2400 meters from the threshold (abeam TWY R) by the time the succeeding aircraft begins its take-off roll. Minimum separation will continue to exist, constant or increasing, between the two departing aircraft immediately after the second aircraft's take-off.

- **RWY 34L:**  
  The preceding aircraft will be airborne and have passed a point at least 2400 meters from the threshold (abeam TWY L8) by the time the succeeding aircraft begins its take-off roll. Minimum separation will continue to exist, constant or increasing, between the two departing aircraft immediately after the second aircraft's take-off.

!!! note
    The succeeding departure may commence its take-off roll, subject to the same conditions, when departing from:

    - **RWY 16L** from A11  
    - **RWY 34R** from A1  
    - **RWY 16R** from L11  
    - **RWY 34L** from L1  

### 4.5.3 Landing following landing
When the runway in use is temporarily occupied by other traffic, landing clearance may be issued to an arriving aircraft, provided the controller has reasonable assurance that the following separation distances and criteria will be met when the landing aircraft crosses the runway threshold:

- **RWY 16L:**  
  The preceding landing aircraft has landed and vacated the runway, or has passed a point at least 2400 meters from the threshold (abeam TWY A5), and is in motion to vacate the runway without stopping or backtracking.

- **RWY 34R:**  
  The preceding landing aircraft has landed and vacated the runway, or has passed a point at least 2400 meters from the threshold (abeam TWY A7), and is in motion to vacate the runway without stopping or backtracking.

- **RWY 16R:**  
  The preceding landing aircraft has landed and vacated the runway, or has passed a point at least 2400 meters from the threshold (abeam TWY R), and is in motion to vacate the runway without stopping or backtracking.

- **RWY 34L:**  
  The preceding landing aircraft has landed and vacated the runway, or has passed a point at least 2400 meters from the threshold (abeam TWY L8), and is in motion to vacate the runway without stopping or backtracking.

!!! note
    Landing RRSM (Reduced Runway Separation Minimum) will only be applied between two successive arrivals, provided both aircraft have been instructed to vacate at published Rapid Exit Taxiways (RETs).

### 4.5.4 Landing following departure
When the runway in use is temporarily occupied by other traffic, landing clearance may be issued to an arriving aircraft, provided the controller has reasonable assurance that the following separation distances and criteria will be met when the landing aircraft crosses the runway threshold:

- **RWY 16L:**  
  The preceding departing aircraft will be airborne and have passed a point at least 2400 meters from the threshold (abeam TWY A5), or if not airborne, will be at least 2400 meters from the threshold.

- **RWY 34R:**  
  The preceding departing aircraft will be airborne and have passed a point at least 2400 meters from the threshold (abeam TWY A7), or if not airborne, will be at least 2400 meters from the threshold.

- **RWY 16R:**  
  The preceding departing aircraft will be airborne and have passed a point at least 2400 meters from the threshold (abeam TWY R), or if not airborne, will be at least 2400 meters from the threshold.

- **RWY 34L:**  
  The preceding departing aircraft will be airborne and have passed a point at least 2400 meters from the threshold (abeam TWY L8), or if not airborne, will be at least 2400 meters from the threshold.

!!! note
    Pilots should be aware of the possibility of a go-around if no landing clearance has been received when approaching 2 NM from the threshold, with another aircraft lined up or departing.

## 4.7 Low visibility operations (LVO)
### 4.7.1 Commencement of LVO
Low visibility operations (LVO) are commenced at Doha-Hamad when:

- Touchdown RVR is indicated to be 600 metres or less;
- Reported meteorological visibility is 600 metres or less;
- The reported cloud ceiling is less than 300 feet

LVO may be pre-emptively initiated when RVR or meteorological visibility is reported at or below 1500 m and forecast to reduce below LVO minima, or the cloud ceiling is reported as 500 ft, and forecast to reduce below LVO minima. 

### 4.7.2 LVO departure procedures
During LVO, aircraft must use CAT II/III holding points for all runways in order to protect ILS-critical areas. 

CAT II/III holding points must be used during LVO for departing aircraft (Table 5-4).

| Runway |     Holding Point    |
|:------:|:--------------------:|
|   16L  |         A10          |
|   16R  | L10/M12/P11/12/13/14 |
|   34L  |  L2/P1/P2/P3/P4/P5   |
|   34R  |          A2          |
<figure markdown>
  <figcaption>Table 4-5: CATII/III holding points</figcaption>
</figure>

## 4.8 Designated areas of responsibility
### 4.8.1 AIR positions
Doha-Hamad has two AIR positions: AIR 1 and AIR 2.

- **AIR 1** controls runway 16L/34R, including all associated exit taxiways and runway holding points.
- **AIR 2** controls runway 16R/34L, including all associated exit taxiways and runway holding points.

The airspace around the airport is divided along the middle of the main concourse. AIR 1 is responsible for the airspace to the east of the concourse, while AIR 2 is responsible for the airspace to the west.

(See sections 6.2 and 6.3)

### 4.8.2 Handoff procedure
Where transfer of control is to be made between aerodrome controllers, aircraft shall not be cleared to a point beyond the current controller’s designated zone of responsibility unless there has been prior coordination with the next controller. Hold short instructions may be used to satisfy this requirement.
For runway crossings, the crossing instruction must only be issued by the designated AIR controller for the respective runway unless prior coordination has been conducted.

### 4.8.3 Splitting procedure
Where there is only one controller, they shall cover all runways and associated airspace from the AIR 1 position. 

Unless otherwise authorised by the Arabian vACC staff, GMP (Hamad Clearance Delivery) and at least one GMC (Hamad Ground) position must be online before two AIR (Hamad Tower) positions may be opened.
