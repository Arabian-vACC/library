# 3. Ground Movement Control ("Hamad Ground")
## 3.1 General provisions
The Ground Movement Controller (GMC) is responsible for managing aircraft movements on all aerodrome movement areas except for runways and their associated taxiways. Departing aircraft are given pushback instructions and instructions to taxi to the runway holding point. Arriving aircraft are assigned a stand and instructed to taxi as appropriate.

## 3.2 Departure pushback procedures
### 3.2.1 General pushback procedures
When aircraft have been handed off from GMP, they shall be fully ready for pushback, and have reached their TOBT. Assuming no obstructions, they shall be instructed to push back immediately. If an aircraft is cleared for push and start but does not begin pushing within 2-5 minutes, the pushback clearance is canceled, and a new TOBT is assigned.

Aircraft requesting push that are not squawking their assigned transponder code shall be instructed to hold position and squawk the correct code. They must not be allowed to move until doing so. 

Pushback direction is based primarily on aircraft location and runway configuration. 

All code F aircraft (A380/B747-8) are not permitted to be pushed onto taxiway W (between taxiway H and stand A4), taxiway E (between taxiway D and stand B2), or taxiway Y.

A pushback clearance must be a variant of those provided in 3.2.2 and include an instruction to “FACE NORTH”, “FACE EAST", “FACE SOUTH" or “FACE WEST” as appropriate with the taxiway to push onto.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Hamad Ground, QTR1, on stand A8 request pushback."

    **Controller**: "QTR1, Hamad Ground, pushback approved, face West on W."

    **Pilot**: "Pushback approved, facing West on W, QTR1."

Conditional pushback instructions may also be issued if an aircraft is taxiing behind another waiting for pushback.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Hamad Ground, FDB12, on stand G3C request pushback."

    **Controller**: "FDB12, Hamad Ground, behind the company 737 passing left to right, pushback approved, face South on E2."

    **Pilot**: "After the company 737 passes from left to right, pushback approved, facing South on E2, FDB12."

### 3.2.2 Pushback types
#### 3.2.2.1 Standard pushback
This type will normally have the aircraft stop abeam the adjacent stand. The phraseology for this type of pushback is identical to the pushback phraseology as provided in 3.2.1.

#### 3.2.2.2 Short pushback
A short pushback instruction shall require the aircraft to complete the pushback abeam the current stand such that the adjacent stand will not be blocked.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Hamad Ground, IBE0392, on stand H10 request pushback."

    **Controller**: "IBE0392, Hamad Ground, short pushback approved, face south on J to finish abeam stand H10."

    **Pilot**: "Short pushback approved, facing west on J to finish abeam stand H10, IBE0392."

#### 3.2.2.3 Long pushback
A long pushback instruction shall require aircraft to complete the pushback operation two stands away from where the pushback was commenced. This manoeuvre may be used when aircraft are vacating a stand to be used by another aircraft that is taxiing in.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Hamad Ground, QTR1184, on stand A7 request pushback."

    **Controller**: "QTR1184, Hamad Ground, long pushback approved, face west on W1 to finish abeam stand A3."

    **Pilot**: "Long pushback approved, facing west on W1 to finish abeam stand A3, QTR1184."

### 3.2.3 Simultaneous pushback operations
Simultaneous pushbacks may be permitted from adjacent stands provided aircraft are instructed to manoeuvre in accordance with 3.2.2 such that on completion of both aircraft’s pushback operation, they will be separated on the taxiway by two aircraft stands.

## 3.3 Departure taxi procedures
### 3.3.1 General departure taxi procedures
Aircraft should be assigned the most suitable taxi route for their designated departure runway. 

Code F aircraft (A380/B747-8) are not permitted to taxi onto taxiway W (between taxiway H and stand A4), taxiway E (between taxiway D and stand B2), or taxiway Y. 

!!! info
    Aircraft should not be taxied to the runway holding points, transfer of control to AIR shall be made early enough such that the aircraft is not required to stop its taxi.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "QTR3B, request taxi."

    **Controller**: "QTR3B, via E1, C, hold short taxiway L2."

    **Pilot**: "Taxi via E1, C, hold short taxiway L2, QTR3B."

To deconflict traffic, and to reduce the length of taxi clearances, intermediate holding points shall be used wherever possible.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "QTR98K, request taxi."

    **Controller**: "QTR98K, taxi via W2, hold short J."

    **Pilot**: "Taxi via W2, hold short J, QTR98K."

## 3.4 Arrival taxi procedures
### 3.4.1 General arrival taxi procedures
Arriving aircraft should not be handed off by AIR immediately upon landing. Instead, they must receive initial taxi instructions to taxiways B, K, or M to maintain traffic flow.  

Aircraft must avoid stopping on rapid exit taxiways and should proceed as follows, unless otherwise directed by the tower:  

- **Vacating 16L:** Continue taxiing southbound via taxiway B.  
- **Vacating 16R:** Continue southbound via taxiway K or M.  
- **Vacating 16R with parking on Apron 5:** Expect a northbound turn onto taxiway K (HIRO does not apply).  
- **Vacating 34L:** Continue northbound via taxiway M unless instructed to vacate to the east (HIRO does not apply when vacating east).  
- **Vacating 34R:** Continue northbound via taxiway B.  

Therefore, GMC should assign an arrival stand to aircraft as soon as they appear on the arrival list, as this facilitates the assignment of the arrival runway for terminal controllers.  

Once the aircraft is handed off to GMC, they can be directed to their assigned stand.

## 3.5 Low visibility operations (LVO)
### 3.5.1 LVO taxi routes
When LVO is in effect, aircraft should avoid crossing the runways whenever possible. All taxiways are approved for LVO operations, and there are no taxiway restrictions.

During LVO, only designated CAT II/III holding points shall be used (4.6.2).

## 3.6 Designated areas of responsibility
### 3.6.1 GMC positions
Doha-Hamad Airport operates three GMC positions: GMC 1, GMC 2, and GMC 3.

#### 3.6.1.1 GMC 1 Responsibilities
GMC 1 manages aircraft movements in the following areas and their associated taxiways:
- Concourse B  
- Concourse C (East Side)  
- Concourse E  
- Central Concourse (shared with GMC 2)  
- Remote Transfer G  
- Cargo Apron  
- Maintenance Apron  
- Apron 4  

#### 3.6.1.2 GMC 2 Responsibilities
GMC 2 manages aircraft movements in the following areas and their associated taxiways:
- Concourse A  
- Concourse C (West Side)  
- Concourse D  
- Central Concourse (shared with GMC 1)  
- Remote Transfer H1  
- Apron 5  

#### 3.6.1.3 GMC 3 Responsibilities
GMC 3 manages aircraft movements in the following area and its associated taxiways:
- Apron 6  

### 3.6.2 Handoff procedures
When transferring control between controllers, aircraft must not be cleared beyond the current controller’s designated area of responsibility unless prior coordination has been completed with the next controller. Hold short instructions may be issued to meet this requirement.

### 3.6.3 Splitting procedure
When a single GMC controller is online, they shall manage all surface movement areas from the GMC 1 position. 

Unless otherwise authorized by Arabian vACC staff, GMP (Hamad Delivery) must be online before three GMC (Hamad Ground) positions can be opened.

If GMP is not online, GMC shall assume the responsibilities of the lower controller.
