# 3. Ground Movement Control ("Hamad Ground")
## 3.1 General provisions
The Ground Movement Controller (GMC) is responsible for managing aircraft movements on all aerodrome movement areas except for runways and their associated taxiways. Departing aircraft are given pushback instructions and instructions to taxi to the runway holding point. Arriving aircraft are assigned a stand and instructed to taxi as appropriate.

## 3.2 Departure pushback procedures
### 3.2.1 General pushback procedures
When aircraft have been handed off from GMP, they shall be fully ready for pushback, and have reached their TOBT. Assuming no obstructions, they shall be instructed to push back immediately. If an aircraft is cleared for push and start but does not begin pushing within 2-5 minutes, the pushback clearance is canceled, and a new TOBT is assigned.

Aircraft requesting push that are not squawking their assigned transponder code shall be instructed to hold position and squawk the correct code. They must not be allowed to move until doing so. 

Pushback direction is based primarily on aircraft location and runway configuration. 

All code F aircraft (A380/B747-8) are not permitted to be pushed onto taxiway W (between taxiway H and stand A4), taxiway E (between taxiway D and stand B2), or taxiway Y.

A pushback clearance must be a variant of those provided in 3.2.2 and include an instruction to “FACE NORTH”, “FACE EAST", “FACE SOUTH" or “FACE WEST” as appropriate with the taxiway to push onto.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Hamad Ground, QTR1, on stand A8 request pushback."

    **Controller**: "QTR1, Hamad Ground, pushback approved, face West on W."

    **Pilot**: "Pushback approved, facing West on W, QTR1."

Conditional pushback instructions may also be issued if an aircraft is taxiing behind another waiting for pushback.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Hamad Ground, FDB12, on stand G3C request pushback."

    **Controller**: "FDB12, Hamad Ground, behind the company 737 passing left to right, pushback approved, face South on E2."

    **Pilot**: "After the company 737 passes from left to right, pushback approved, facing South on E2, FDB12."

### 3.2.2 Pushback types
#### 3.2.2.1 Standard pushback
This type will normally have the aircraft stop abeam the adjacent stand. The phraseology for this type of pushback is identical to the pushback phraseology as provided in 3.2.1.

#### 3.2.2.2 Short pushback
A short pushback instruction shall require the aircraft to complete the pushback abeam the current stand such that the adjacent stand will not be blocked.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Hamad Ground, IBE0392, on stand H10 request pushback."

    **Controller**: "IBE0392, Hamad Ground, short pushback approved, face south on J to finish abeam stand H10."

    **Pilot**: "Short pushback approved, facing west on J to finish abeam stand H10, IBE0392."

#### 3.2.2.3 Long pushback
A long pushback instruction shall require aircraft to complete the pushback operation two stands away from where the pushback was commenced. This manoeuvre may be used when aircraft are vacating a stand to be used by another aircraft that is taxiing in.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Hamad Ground, QTR1184, on stand A7 request pushback."

    **Controller**: "QTR1184, Hamad Ground, long pushback approved, face west on W1 to finish abeam stand A3."

    **Pilot**: "Long pushback approved, facing west on W1 to finish abeam stand A3, QTR1184."

### 3.2.3 Simultaneous pushback operations
Simultaneous pushbacks may be permitted from adjacent stands provided aircraft are instructed to manoeuvre in accordance with 3.2.2 such that on completion of both aircraft’s pushback operation, they will be separated on the taxiway by two aircraft stands.

### 3.2.4 Concourse A
Aircraft parked at Concourse A shall be instructed to face West onto taxiway W and W1.

### 3.2.6 Concourse C
Aircraft parked at Concourse C on stands C1 to C8 shall be instructed to push back facing south onto E1 or W1 as required. 

Aircraft parked on stands C9 to C12 shall be instructed to push back facing north onto E4 or W4 as required.

In some cases, aircraft may be pushed onto E2 or W2 facing south, or onto E3 or W3 facing north, based on operational needs.

### 3.2.7 Concourse D
Aircraft parked at Concourse D shall be instructed to face North onto W4.

Aircraft may occasionally be pushed onto W3 facing North.

## 3.3 Departure taxi procedures

Code F aircraft (A380/B747-8) are not permitted to taxi onto taxiway W (between taxiway H and stand A4), taxiway E (between taxiway D and stand B2), or taxiway Y. 

!!! info
    Where aircraft are taxied to runway holding points, transfer of control to AIR shall be made early enough such that the aircraft is not required to stop its taxi.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "QTR3B, request taxi."

    **Controller**: "QTR3B, taxi via W2, K, holding point L, runway 34L."

    **Pilot**: "Taxi via W2, K, holding point L, runway 34L, QTR3B."

To deconflict traffic, and to reduce the length of taxi clearances, intermediate holding points shall be used wherever possible.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "QTR98K, request taxi."

    **Controller**: "QTR98K, taxi via W2, hold short J."

    **Pilot**: "Taxi via W2, hold short J, QTR98K."
