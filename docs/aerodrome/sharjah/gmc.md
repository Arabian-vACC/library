# 3. Ground Movement Procedures
## 3.1 General provisions
GMC is also responsible for managing aircraft movements on all aerodrome movement areas except 
for runways and their associated taxiways. Departing aircraft are given pushback instructions and 
instructions to taxi to the runway holding point. Arriving aircraft are assigned a stand and instructed 
to taxi as appropriate. 

## 3.2 Departure pushback procedures
### 3.2.1 General pushback procedures
Assuming no obstructions, aircraft shall be instructed to pushback immediately.

Aircraft requesting pushback that are not squawking their assigned transponder code shall be instructed to hold position and squawk the correct code; movement of such aircraft is prohibited.

Pushback direction is based primarily on aircraft location and runway configuration.

On aprons F and A, all traffic shall be instructed to pushback on taxiway Z. 

Aircraft on stands 1A, 1B, 1C, stands 11 to 26 and stands 50 to 62 shall be instructed to pushback *"facing North".*

Aircraft on stands 2 to 7 shall be instructed to pushback *"facing East".*

Aircraft on stands 2 to 7 shall be instructed to pushback *"facing East".*

!!! example
      **Controller:** RJA613, Sharjah ground, pushback approved, facing east.

      **Pilot:** Pushback approved, facing east, RJA613.

!!! note
      Conditional pushback instructions may also be issued if an aircraft is taxiing behind another waiting for pushback.

!!! example
      **Controler:** RJA613, Sharjah ground, behind the AirArabia A320 passing right to left, pushback approved, facing east, behind.

      **Pilot:** Behind the AirArabia A320 passing right to left, pushback approved, facing east, behind, RJA613.

### 3.2.2 Pushback types
#### 3.2.2.1 Standard pushback
This type will normally have the aircraft stop abeam the adjacent stand. The phraseology for this type of pushback is identical to the pushback phraseology as provided in 2.8.1.

#### 3.2.2.2 Short pushback
A short pushback instruction shall require the aircraft to complete the pushback abeam the current stand such that the adjacent stand will not be blocked.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Sharjah Ground, ABY8KC, on stand 3 request pushback."

    **Controller**: "ABY8KC, Sharjah Ground, short pushback approved, face east on A to finish abeam stand 64."

    **Pilot**: "Short pushback approved, facing east on A to finish abeam stand 4, ABY8KC."

#### 3.2.2.3 Long pushback
A long pushback instruction shall require aircraft to complete the pushback operation two stands away from where the pushback was commenced. This manoeuvre may be used when aircraft are vacating a stand to be used by another aircraft that is taxiing in.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Sharjah Ground, ABY8KC, on stand 4 request pushback."

    **Controller**: "ABY8KC, Sharjah Ground, long pushback approved, face east on A to finish abeam stand 6."

    **Pilot**: "Long pushback approved, facing east on A to finish abeam stand 6, ABY8KC."

#### 3.2.3 Simultaneous pushback procedure
Simultaneous pushback operations shall be permitted so long as aircraft are separated by at least 2 stands upon completion of their pushback.

!!!warning
      Simultaneous pushback operations are not permitted into the same alleyway for stands 11 to 26 and on stands 1A, 1B and 1C.

## 3.4 Departure taxi procedures
### 3.4.1 General departure taxi procedures
Where aircraft are taxied to runway holding points, transfer of control to AIR should be made early enough such that the aircraft is not required to stop its taxi. 

To deconflict traffic and to reduce the length of taxi clearances, intermediate holding points shall be used wherever possible.

!!! example
      **Controller:** ABY436, Taxi via A, A20, holding point B20, Runway 30.

      **Pilot:** Taxi via A, A20, holding point B20, Runway 30, ABY436.

### 3.4.2 Runway 30 departure taxi procedures
When departing from 30, aircraft taxiing from passenger apron (stands 1A to 26) shall be instructed to taxi via A and A20 to holding point B20. 

Aircraft on the cargo apron (stands 50 to 62) shall be instructed to taxi via Z8, A8 and B to holding point B20.

!!! warning
      Eastbound traffic flow on B must be avoided between B2 and B7, as this blocks the exit taxiways from runway 30.

*(See 5.1)*
### 3.4.3 Runway 12 departure taxi procedures
When departing from 12, aircraft taxiing from passenger apron (stands 1A to 26) shall be instructed to taxi via A and A2 to holding point B2.

Aircraft on the cargo apron (stands 50 to 62) shall be instructed to taxi via Z8, A8 and B to holding point B2. 

!!! warning
      Westbound traffic flow on B must be avoided between B14 and B11, as this blocks the exit taxiways from runway 12.

*(See 5.4)*

## 3.5 Arrival taxi procedures
### 3.5.1 General arrival taxi procedures
GMC shall assign an arrival stand to aircraft when they are on final approach.

Once the aircraft is handed off to GMC, they shall be taxied to their stand in accordance with the procedures laid down in 2.10.4. 

*(See 5.2)*

### 3.5.2 Runway 30 arrival taxi procedures
Aircraft shall vacate 30 onto B7 or B6 and are then handed off to GMC.

Aircraft shall be taxied via A6 and A to the appropriate stand. 

*(See 5.2)*

### 3.5.3 Runway 12 arrival taxi procedures
Aircraft shall vacate 30 onto B11 or B14 and are then handed off to GMC.

Aircraft shall be taxied via A14 and A to the appropriate stand.

!!! warning
      Aircraft shall not be instructed to make a right turn on A12 after vacating B11. They shall always make a left turn onto B.

*(See 5.3)*

- Touchdown RVR is indicated to be 1500m or less;
- Reported meteorological visibility is 1500m or less;
- The reported cloud ceiling is 500ft or less

LVO may be pre-emptively initiated when RVR or meteorological visibility is reported at or below 3000 m and forecast to reduce below LVO minima, or the cloud ceiling is reported as 700 ft and forecast to reduce below LVO minima.  

Runway crossings shall be kept to a minimum and must only occur at designated LVO runway crossing points.

      All operations shall be suspended if RVR falls below 350 metres. 

Only CAT II/III holding points may be used during LVO.

## 3.7 Designated areas of responsibility
### 3.7.1 GMC positions
GMC is responsible for all aprons and associated taxiways.

*(See 5.1)*

### 3.7.2 Handoff procedure
Where transfer of control is to be made between controllers, aircraft shall not be cleared to a point beyond the current controllerâ€™s designated zone of responsibility unless there has been prior coordination with the next controller. Intermediate holding points may be used to satisfy this requirement.
