# 2. Ground Movement Control ("Al Maktoum Ground")
## 2.1 General provisions
Ground Movement Control (GMC) is responsible for validating routes and shall provide IFR clearance to departing aircraft. The controller shall assign the correct departure procedure to the aircraft based on the first point that is filed on the flight plan.

Where the flight plan contains an invalid route, level, or departure procedure, GMC shall ensure that the error is corrected before the aircraft is given its clearance.

GMC is also responsible for managing aircraft movements on all aerodrome movement areas except for runways and their associated taxiways. Departing aircraft are given pushback instructions and instructions to taxi to the runway holding point. Arriving aircraft are assigned a stand and instructed to taxi as appropriate.

## 2.2 Departure clearance
### 2.2.1 General
The GMC is responsible for issuing clearances for departing aircraft. Pilots may be expected to report the following information on first contact:

- Aircraft Callsign;
- Aircraft type;
- Parking Stand;
- Destination;
- Dubai CTA exit point;
- Speed if unable to comply with minimum speed on the SID;
- ATIS letter & QNH;

### 2.2.2 Information contained in a departure clearance
An IFR clearance shall be in the following format:

- Callsign;
- Destination;
- Departure procedure;
- Initially cleared altitude;
- Assigned SSR code

OMDW GMC shall obtain a full readback of the clearance. If the pilot does not report the current ATIS letter on first contact, OMDW GMC shall pass the current ATIS letter and QNH.

Departing aircraft shall be instructED to report ready for pushback.

!!! example

    **Pilot**: "Al Maktoum Ground, good evening, UAE9782, Boeing 777-200LR, stand S298, requesting IFR clearance to Hong Kong, exiting the Dubai control zone at ANVIX"
    
    **Controller**: "UAE9782, cleared to Hong Kong via the ANVIX4L departure, maintain altitude 3000ft, squawk 0542."
    
    **Pilot**: "Cleared to Hong Kong, ANVIX4L departure, maintain altitude 3000ft, squawk 0542, UAE9782."

    **Controller**: "UAE9782, readback correct, information Foxtrot, QNH 1009, report ready for pushback."

### 2.2.3 Datalink clearance (DCL)
Aircraft clearance may also be delivered by DCL. This type of clearance reduces controller workload and frequency congestion. For suitably equipped aircraft, this will be through the ACARS system on board the aircraft.
### 2.2.4 Aircraft requiring a reroute
Aircraft requiring a reroute shall not be given a DCL. Instead, a voice clearance must be used. This shall be communicated by ACARS datalink message or on frequency.
### 2.2.5 Voice clearance
Aircraft requesting clearance via voice shall be given a voice clearance as per the format in 2.2.2.
