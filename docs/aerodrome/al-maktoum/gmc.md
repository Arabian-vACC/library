# 4. Ground Movement Control ("Al Maktoum Ground")
## 4.1 General provisions
GMC is also responsible for managing aircraft movements on all aerodrome movement areas except for runways and their associated taxiways. Departing aircraft are given pushback instructions and instructions to taxi to the runway holding point. Arriving aircraft are assigned a stand and instructed to taxi as appropriate.

## 4.2 Departure pushback procedures
### 4.2.1 General pushback procedures
Assuming no obstructions, aircraft shall be instructed to pushback immediately.

Aircraft requesting pushback that are not squawking their assigned transponder code shall be instructed to hold position and squawk the correct code; movement of such aircraft is prohibited.

Pushback direction is based primarily on aircraft location and runway configuration.

!!! example
      **Controller:** UAE9212, Al Maktoum Ground, pushback approved, facing north.

      **Pilot:** Pushback approved, facing north, UAE9212.

!!! note
      Conditional pushback instructions may also be issued if an aircraft is taxiing behind another waiting for pushback.

!!! example
      **Controler:** CLX215, Al Maktoum Ground, behind the Execujet Global 7500, passing right to left, pushback approved, facing east, behind.

      **Pilot:** Behind the Execujet Global 7500, passing right to left, pushback approved, facing east, behind, CLX215.

### 4.2.2 Pushback types
#### 4.2.2.1 Standard pushback
This type will normally have the aircraft stop abeam the adjacent stand. The phraseology for this type of pushback is identical to the pushback phraseology as provided in 2.7.1.

#### 4.2.2.2 Short pushback
A short pushback instruction shall require the aircraft to complete the pushback abeam the current stand such that the adjacent stand will not be blocked.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Al Maktoum Ground, EJO155, on stand G22B request pushback."

    **Controller**: "EJO155, Al Maktoum Ground, short pushback approved, face west on Z14 to finish abeam stand G22B."

    **Pilot**: "Short pushback approved, facing west on Z14 to finish abeam stand G22B, EJO155."

#### 4.3.2.3 Long pushback
A long pushback instruction shall require aircraft to complete the pushback operation two stands away from where the pushback was commenced. This manoeuvre may be used when aircraft are vacating a stand to be used by another aircraft that is taxiing in.
!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Al Maktoum Ground, UAE9154, on stand S295 request pushback."

    **Controller**: "UAE9154, Al Maktoum Ground, long pushback approved, face north on Z5 to finish abeam stand S297."

    **Pilot**: "Long pushback approved, facing north on Z5 to finish abeam stand S297, UAE9154."
#### 4.3.3 Simultaneous pushback procedure
Simultaneous pushback operations shall be permitted so long as aircraft are separated by at least 2 stands upon completion of their pushback.

!!!warning
      Simultaneous pushback operations are not permitted into the same alleyway for stands 11 to 26 and on stands 1A, 1B and 1C.

## 4.4 Departure taxi procedures
### 4.4.1 General departure taxi procedures
Where aircraft are taxied to runway holding points, transfer of control to AIR should be made early enough such that the aircraft is not required to stop its taxi. 

To deconflict traffic and to reduce the length of taxi clearances, intermediate holding points shall be used wherever possible.

!!! example
      **Pilot:** Al Maktoum Ground, UAE9876, request taxi.

      **Controller:** UAE9876, Al Maktoum Ground, Taxi via Z7, Z, hold ZM.

      **Pilot:** Taxi via Z7, Z, hold ZM, UAE9876.
