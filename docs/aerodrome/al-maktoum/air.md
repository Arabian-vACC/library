# 5. Air Control Procedures
## 5.1 General provisions
Al Maktoum Tower is responsible for all aerodrome movements on runway 12/30 and the associated taxiways. Academy Tower is responsible for movements on runway 13/31 and the surrounding circuit. These positions shall also ensure separation between IFR aircraft that are arriving at and departing the aerodrome, as well as provide traffic information between IFR and VFR aircraft operating within the aerodrome control zone.

!!! info 
      Al Maktoum Tower **does not** provide top down coverage for the EFTA, and therefore does not cover runway 13/31, or traffic within the circuit.

## 5.2 Departure procedures
### 5.2.1 Standard departure points
Al Maktoum has “standard departure points” from which pilots are expected to base their performance calculations. Aircraft may be tactically issued holding points closer to the runway end to optimise traffic flow or to yield a more efficient departure sequence. If the standard departure point is insufficient, crews must advice ATC of the required departure on first contact. The AIR controller may issue delays for such departures based on runway dependency requirements, as priority is given to the standard departure points.

| Runway | Standard departure points |
|:------:|:-------------------------:|
|   30   |           V16             |
|   12   |            V4             |
|   31   |            A6             |
|   13   |            A2             |

!!! note
    V13 intersection departure may be used for departing aircraft on runway 30 if traffic permits. 

### 5.2.2 Line up clearances
Aircraft that have reached the runway holding points for departure shall be told to line-up once the runway is vacant and there is room to maneuver the aircraft onto the runway.

!!! example
      **Controller:** UAE9284, via V16, line up and wait, runway 30.

      **Pilot:** Via V16, line up and wait, runway 30, UAE9824.

Conditional line up instructions must also include the traffic that the aircraft is to follow, as well as the word “behind” at the beginning and end of the transmission. It is suggested to only have a maximum of two conditional line up clearances active at one i.e. one aircraft lining up behind a departure, and another aircraft lining up behind them. 

!!! example
      **Controller:** UAE9824, behind the departing Cathay B747, via V16, line up and wait runway 30, behind.

      **Pilot:** Behind the departing Cathay B747, via V16, line up & wait runway 30, behind.

### 5.2.3 Take-off clearances
Aircraft shall be cleared for take-off once adequate separation exists as provided in 5.3.4 

!!! example
      **Controler:** ABW255, (surface) wind 330 degrees, 7 knots, runway 30, cleared for takeoff.

      **Pilot:** Cleared for takeoff, runway 30, ABW255.
      
### 5.2.4 Separation requirements
#### 5.2.4.1 General
Aircraft shall be separated on departure in compliance with standard IFR departure separation minima or enhanced wake turbulence separation (eWTS) requirements. 
 
Except as provided in 5.2.4.2, succeeding aircraft on the same SID shall be separated by a minimum of **2 minutes.**  

VFR aircraft may be instructed to maintain visual separation with preceding aircraft and given a take-off clearance if no wake turbulence separation minima exists.
are able to achieve minimum separation requirements when reaching the respective Dubai CTA exit point. 

### 5.2.4.2 Muscat FIR flow control procedure
Special flow control procedures are required for traffic entering the Muscat FIR via certain entry 
points after departure from UAE airports.  

During off-peak times, this separation minima may be disregarded, and standard separation minima of 2 minutes may be applied provided it is not done for more than two successive departures. 

<figure markdown>
|  SID  | FIR exit point | Longitudinal separation |
|:-----:|:--------------:|:-----------------------:|
| ANVIX |      TARDI     |        3 minutes        |
| IVURO |  LALDO/GOMTA   |        3 minutes        |

  <figcaption>Table 5-2: Flow control procedures for traffic entering the Muscat FIR</figcaption>
</figure>

!!! note
      LALDO and GOMTA are to be considered a common FIR exit point. These procedures do not apply to traffic landing at airports within the Muscat FIR. 

### 5.2.5 IFR handoff procedure
IFR departures shall be handed off to Al Maktoum Radar. 

Where Al Maktoum Radar is offline, all handoffs shall be to OMDB_1_DEP. If DEP 1 is offline, handoffs shall be made to OMDB_APP.

Where no approach controller is present, aircraft shall be handed off directly to the appropriate UAE controller.

### 5.2.6 Radar departures
Aircraft on a radar departure shall be instructed to fly a specific heading on departure to increase separation or to clear the departure path for a following aircraft. This departure instruction shall be delivered to the aircraft before issuing the take-off clearance. 

The headings to be issued shall be coordinated with departures control. 

!!! example
      **Controller:** QTR801, after departure fly heading 320, maintain altitude 3000ft, wind 280 degrees, 6 knots, runway 30, cleared for takeoff.

      **Pilot:** After departure fly heading 320, maintain altitude 3000ft, wind 280 degrees, 6 knots, runway 30, cleared for takeoff, QTR801.

### 5.2.7 Stopping a departure
Aircraft that have commenced their take-off roll may be instructed to stop immediately to avert a collision due to a runway incursion or any other dangerous situation.

!!! warning
      The instruction to stop must be given early enough such that the aircraft does not reach its decision speed. Therefore, aerodrome controllers must be vigilant and remain aware of the location of traffic and all times as well as runway incursion hotspots. 

!!! example
      **Controller:** UAE9824, Stop immediately, I say again stop immediately, vehicle entering the runway!

For aircraft that have been given a take-off clearance, but have not yet started the roll, they should be instructed to hold position and the take-off clearance must be cancelled along with the reason for cancellation.

!!! example
      **Controller:** UAE9282, hold position, cancel takeoff clearance, I say again cancel takeoff clearance, aircraft entering the runway, acknowledge.

## 5.3 Arrival procedures
### 5.3.1 Speed control
#### 5.3.1.1 General
Although the radar controllers are responsible for separating arriving aircraft, the AIR controller shall still ensure that minimum separation is maintained until the preceding aircraft crosses the runway threshold.

#### 5.3.1.2 Speed control
If it is apparent that minimum separation may not exist as provided in Dubai Enhanced Wake Turbulence Separation (eWTS) or minimum radar separation minima, AIR may use a tactical reduction in aircraft speed.

!!! example
      **Controller:** EJO21M, reduce to final approach speed.

#### 5.3.1.3 Visual separation
Aircraft may be instructed to maintain own separation visually, if speed control alone will not resolve the conflict. This shall only be done in VMC and with agreement with the pilot. If no other solutions are practical, the succeeding aircraft shall be instructed to go around. 

!!! example
      **Controller:** UAE4V, traffic is at your 3 oclock, 4 miles, report in sight,
      **Pilot:** Traffic in sight, UAE4V.
      **Controller:** UAE4V, thanks, maintain visual separation.
      **Pilot:** Maintaining visual separation, UAE4V.

### 5.3.2 Go around instruction
At any time should a runway become unsuitable for an aircraft landing, or separation minima is not met, aircraft shall be instructed to go-around. 

!!! example
      **Controller:** EJO21M, Go around, I say again, go around, acknowledge.

Once aircraft are observed to be safely climbing away, they shall be handed off to departure control. 

!!! example
      **Controller:** EJO21M, Climb to 3000ft via standard missed approach, contact Al Maktoum Radar 124.025.

### 5.3.3 Arrival taxi procedures
Aircraft shall be provided an initial taxi clearance to ensure they are kept moving such that the exit taxiway (RET) is clear for the next arrival and to minimise runway occupancy times. Aircaft shall taxi on to V initially in the direction of the landing runway. Acute turns from rapid exit taxiways are not permitted.

The initial taxi shall include instructions to taxi “LEFT” or “RIGHT” onto the relevant taxiway as appropriate and hold at a suitable intermediate holding point. 

!!! example
      **Controller:** EJO21M, Taxi left on V, hold short VM.

Once aircraft have been observed to be taxiing and completely clear of the exit, transfer of control shall be initiated to GMC provided there will be no conflicts with other arriving traffic.  

!!! note
      Aircraft may normally be expected to vacate on V10 in the 30 direction or V9 in the 12 direction.  

!!! note
      If required for separation and to expedite traffic, aircraft may be instructed to vacate via the appropriate rapid exit taxiway on initial contact. 

## 5.4 VFR procedures
### 5.4.1 VFR departures
Once VFR aircraft are ready for departure, they should be cleared for take-off in sequence. As they begin their crosswind turn (the first turn after departure) they shall be instructed to report leaving the control zone.

Once aircraft are clear of the zone, they shall be instructed to remain outside controlled airspace and monitor advisory.

Aircraft climbing into controlled airspace shall be handed off to departure control. 

### 5.4.2 VFR traffic remaining in the circuit
AIR control is responsible for managing circuit traffic. Circuits must always be conducted to the south of the aerodrome for runways 31/13 and to the north of the aerodrome for runways 31/12

Circuits shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures laid down in 3.7.3.

Once aircraft are ready for departure, they should be cleared for take-off in sequence. As they begin their crosswind turn (the first turn after departure) they shall be instructed to report when they are on the downwind with their intentions. 

!!! example
      **Controller:** EFC54L, report downwind with intentions.

Aircraft may request either a touch and go (where the aircraft lands and immediately takes off), a stop and go (where the aircraft lands, comes to a complete stop on the runway, then takes off), a low approach (where the aircraft flies low over the runway without landing), or a full stop (where the aircraft lands and vacates the runway).

Once AIR is aware of the aircraft’s request, they may be sequenced to the runway, with due consideration given to runway occupancy time. 

Aircraft on the downwind should be passed the following information: 
- Expected runway;
- Sequence; 
- Traffic information if applicable

!!! example
      **Controller:** EFC54L, report final runway 31, number 1, traffic is a Boeing 777 on a 5 mile final runway 30.

### 5.4.3 VFR arrivals
Inbound VFR aircraft shall be instructed to contact AIR with enough time such that two-way radio communications has been established before aircraft enter the aerodrome control zone. On first contact, AIR will pass circuit joining instructions, as well as any other pertinent information. 

!!! example
      **Controller:** EFC54L, Academy Tower, join left hand downwind runway 31, 1000ft VFR, QNH 1001

VFR arrivals may be denied entry into the control zone during times of increased IFR arrival activity and instructed to hold outside controller airspace awaiting further instructions.
