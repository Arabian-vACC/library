# 3. Air Control (“Al Maktoum Tower”)
## 3.1 General provisions
Air Control (AIR) is responsible for all aerodrome movements on runways and their associated taxiways. AIR shall also ensure separation between IFR aircraft that are arriving at and departing the aerodrome, as well as provide traffic information between IFR and VFR aircraft operating within the aerodrome control zone.

## 3.2 Preferential runways
Due to the close interaction between arrival and departure procedures within the Dubai CTA, the active runway at Sharjah shall be determined by the active runway direction at Dubai airport. 

## 3.3 Departure procedures
### 3.3.1 Standard departure points
Al Maktoum has “standard departure points” from which pilots are expected to base their performance calculations. Aircraft may be tactically issued holding points closer to the runway end to optimise traffic flow or to yield a more efficient departure sequence. If the standard departure point is insufficient, crews must advice ATC of the required departure on first contact. The AIR controller may issue delays for such departures based on runway dependency requirements, as priority is given to the standard departure points.

| Runway | Standard departure points |
|:------:|:-------------------------:|
|   30  |          V16               |
|   12  |          V4                |
|   31  |          M1C/N1C          |
|   13  |             K5            |

### 3.3.1 Line up clearances
Aircraft that have reached the runway holding points for departure shall be told to line-up once the runway is vacant and there is room to maneuver the aircraft onto the runway.

!!! example
      **Controller:** ABY9KC, via B20, line up, runway 30.

      **Pilot:** Via B20, line up, runway 30, ABY9KC.

Conditional line up instructions must also include the traffic that the aircraft is to follow, as well as the word “behind” at the beginning and end of the transmission. It is suggested to only have a maximum of two conditional line up clearances active at one i.e. one aircraft lining up behind a departure, and another aircraft lining up behind them. 

!!! example
      **Controller:** ABY9KC, behind the departing AirArabia A320, via B20, line up runway 30, behind.

      **Pilot:** Behind the departing AirArabia A320, via B20, line up runway 30, behind.

### 3.3.2 Take-off clearances
Aircraft shall be cleared for take-off once adequate separation exists as provided in 3.3.4 

!!! example
      **Controler:** ABW255, (surface) wind 330 degrees, 7 knots, runway 30, cleared for takeoff.

      **Pilot:** Cleared for takeoff, runway 30, ABW255.
### 3.3.3 Separation requirements
#### 3.3.3.1 General
Aircraft shall be separated on departure in compliance with standard IFR departure separation minima or enhanced wake turbulence separation (eWTS) requirements. 
 
Except as provided in 3.3.3.2 and 3.3.3.3, succeeding aircraft on the same SID shall be separated by a minimum of **2 minutes.**  

VFR aircraft may be instructed to maintain visual separation with preceding aircraft and given a take-off clearance if no wake turbulence separation minima exists.
#### 3.3.3.2 Dubai CTA flow control procedure 
Release of aircraft departing from Sharjah shall be coordinated with DEP, APP and Dubai AIR when there is a high volume of departing traffic from Dubai outbound to the same exit point as Sharjah traffic.

The departure release shall ensure that aircraft are able to achieve minimum separation requirements when reaching the respective Dubai CTA exit point. 

### 3.3.3.3 Muscat FIR flow control procedure
Special flow control procedures are required for traffic entering the Muscat FIR via certain entry 
points after departure from UAE airports.  

During off-peak times, this separation minima may be disregarded, and standard separation minima of 2 minutes may be applied provided it is not done for more than two successive departures. 

|  SID  | FIR exit point | Longitudinal separation |
|:-----:|:--------------:|:-----------------------:|
| ANVIX |      TARDI     |        3 minutes        |
| IVURO |  LALDO/GOMTA   |        3 minutes        |
<figure markdown>
  <figcaption>Table 3-1: Flow control procedures for traffic entering the Muscat FIR</figcaption>
</figure>

!!! note
      LALDO and GOMTA are to be considered a common FIR exit point. These procedures do not apply to traffic landing at Oman airports. 

### 3.3.4 IFR handoff procedure
IFR departures shall not receive a hand-off from tower and are expected to change frequency after departure. 

AIR may re-iterate the frequency change before issuing the take-off clearance to departing IFR aircraft.

!!! info
      All departures shall be handed off to DEP 2. 

### 3.3.5 Radar departures
Aircraft on a radar departure shall be instructed to fly a specific heading on departure to increase separation or to clear the departure path for a following aircraft. This departure instruction shall be delivered to the aircraft before issuing the take-off clearance. 

The headings to be issued shall be coordinated with departures control. 

!!! example
      **Controller:** GFA502, after departure fly heading 270, maintain altitude 2000ft, wind 280 degrees, 6 knots, runway 30, cleared for takeoff.

      **Pilot:** After departure fly heading 270, maintain altitude 2000ft, wind 280 degrees, 6 knots, runway 30, cleared for takeoff, GFA502

### 3.3.6 Stopping a departure
Aircraft that have commenced their take-off roll may be instructed to stop immediately to avert a collision due to a runway incursion or any other dangerous situation.

!!! warning
      The instruction to stop must be given early enough such that the aircraft does not reach its decision speed. Therefore, aerodrome controllers must be vigilant and remain aware of the location of traffic and all times as well as runway incursion hotspots. 

!!! example
      **Controller:** ABY1KM, Stop immediately, I say again stop immediately, vehicle entering the runway!

For aircraft that have been given a take-off clearance, but have not yet started the roll, they should be instructed to hold position and the take-off clearance must be cancelled along with the reason for cancellation.

!!! example
      **Controller:** ABY1KM, hold position, cancel takeoff, I say again cancel takeoff, aircraft entering the runway, acknowledge.

## 3.4 Arrival procedures
### 3.4.1 Preferred exit points

V10 RWY 30

### 3.4.1 Speed control
#### 3.4.1.1 General
Although the radar controllers are responsible for separating arriving aircraft, the AIR controller shall still ensure that minimum separation is maintained until the preceding aircraft crosses the runway threshold.

#### 3.4.1.2 Speed control
If it is apparent that minimum separation may not exist as provided in Dubai Enhanced Wake Turbulence Separation (eWTS) or minimum radar separation minima, AIR may use a tactical reduction in aircraft speed.

!!! example
      **Controller:** ABY187, reduce to final approach speed.

#### 3.4.1.3 Visual separation
Aircraft may be instructed to maintain own separation visually, if speed control alone will not resolve the conflict. This shall only be done in VMC and with agreement with the pilot. If no other solutions are practical, the succeeding aircraft shall be instructed to go around. 

### 3.4.2 Go around instruction
At any time should a runway become unsuitable for an aircraft landing, or separation minima is not met, aircraft shall be instructed to go-around. 

!!! example
      **Controller:** ABW427, Go around, I say again, go around, acknowledge.

Once aircraft are observed to be safely climbing away, they shall be handed off to departure control. 

!!! example
      **Controller:** ABW427, Climb to 2000ft via standard missed approach, contact Dubai departures 124.675.



### 3.4.3 Arrival taxi procedures
Aircraft shall be provided an initial taxi clearance to ensure they are kept moving such that the exit taxiway (RET) is clear for the next arrival and to minimise runway occupancy times. 

The initial taxi shall include instructions to taxi “LEFT” or “RIGHT” onto the relevant taxiway as appropriate and hold at a suitable intermediate holding point. 

!!! example
      **Controller:** ABY572, Taxi left via A6, hold short A.

Once aircraft have been observed to be taxiing and completely clear of the exit, transfer of control shall be initiated to GMC provided there will be no conflicts with other arriving traffic. 

!!! note
      Aircraft may normally be expected to vacate on B6 in the 30 direction or B14 in the 12 direction.  

!!! note
      If required for separation and to expedite traffic, aircraft may be instructed to vacate via the appropriate rapid exit taxiway on initial contact. 

## 3.5 VFR procedures
### 3.5.1 VFR departures
Once VFR aircraft are ready for departure, they should be cleared for take-off in sequence. As they begin their crosswind turn (the first turn after departure) they shall be instructed to report leaving the control zone.

Once aircraft are clear of the zone, they shall be instructed to remain outside controlled airspace and monitor advisory.

Aircraft climbing into controlled airspace shall be handed off to departure control. 

### 3.5.2 VFR traffic remaining in the circuit
AIR control is responsible for managing circuit traffic. Circuits must always be conducted to the north of the aerodrome

Circuits shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures laid down in 2.7.3.

Once aircraft are ready for departure, they should be cleared for take-off in sequence. As they begin their crosswind turn (the first turn after departure) they shall be instructed to report when they are on the downwind with their intentions. 

!!! example
      **Controller:** A6-CTL, report downwind with intentions.

Aircraft may request either a touch and go (where the aircraft lands and immediately takes off), a stop and go (where the aircraft lands, comes to a complete stop on the runway, then takes off), a low approach (where the aircraft flies low over the runway without landing), or a full stop (where the aircraft lands and vacates the runway).

Once AIR is aware of the aircraft’s request, they may be sequenced to the runway, with due consideration given to runway occupancy time. 

Aircraft on the downwind should be passed the following information: 
- Expected runway;
- Sequence; 
- Traffic information if applicable

!!! example
      **Controller:** A6-CTL, report final runway 30, number 1, traffic is an A320 upwind runway 30.

### 3.5.3 VFR arrivals
Inbound VFR aircraft shall be instructed to contact AIR with enough time such that two-way radio communications has been established before aircraft enter the aerodrome control zone. On first contact, AIR will pass circuit joining instructions, as well as any other pertinent information. 

!!! example
      **Controller:** A6-CTA, Sharjah tower, join left hand downwind runway 30, 1000ft VFR, QNH 1017

VFR arrivals may be denied entry into the control zone during times of increased IFR arrival activity and instructed to hold outside controller airspace awaiting further instructions.
