# 3. Ground Movement Control ("Muscat Ground")
## 3.1 General provisions
The Ground Movement Controller (GMC) is responsible for managing aircraft movements on all aerodrome movement areas except for runways and their associated taxiways. Departing aircraft are given pushback instructions and instructions to taxi to the runway holding point. Arriving aircraft are assigned a stand and instructed to taxi as appropriate.

## 3.2 Departure pushback procedures
### 3.2.1 General pushback procedures
When aircraft have been handed off from GMP, they shall be fully ready for pushback. Assuming no obstructions, they shall be instructed to push back immediately. If an aircraft is cleared for push and start but does not begin pushing within 2-5 minutes, the pushback clearance is canceled.

Aircraft requesting push that are not squawking their assigned transponder code shall be instructed to hold position and squawk the correct code. They must not be allowed to move until doing so. 

Pushback direction is based primarily on aircraft location and runway configuration. 

A pushback clearance must be a variant of those provided in 3.2.2 and include an instruction to “FACE NORTH”, “FACE EAST", “FACE SOUTH" or “FACE WEST” as appropriate with the taxiway to push onto.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Muscat Ground, OMA601, on stand 105 request pushback."

    **Controller**: "OMA601, Muscat Ground, pushback approved, face North on S."

    **Pilot**: "Pushback approved, facing North on S, OMA601."

Conditional pushback instructions may also be issued if an aircraft is taxiing behind another waiting for pushback.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Muscat Ground, OMA667, on stand 201 request pushback."

    **Controller**: "OMA667, Muscat Ground, behind the company 737 passing left to right, pushback approved, face North on UE."

    **Pilot**: "After the company 737 passes from left to right, pushback approved, facing North on UE, OMA667."

### 3.2.2 Pushback types
#### 3.2.2.1 Standard pushback
This type will normally have the aircraft stop abeam the adjacent stand. The phraseology for this type of pushback is identical to the pushback phraseology as provided in 3.2.1.

#### 3.2.2.2 Short pushback
A short pushback instruction shall require the aircraft to complete the pushback abeam the current stand such that the adjacent stand will not be blocked.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Muscat Ground, OMA643, on stand 303 request pushback."

    **Controller**: "OMA643, Muscat Ground, short pushback approved, face East on T to finish abeam stand 303."

    **Pilot**: "Short pushback approved, facing East on T to finish abeam stand 303, OMA643."

#### 3.2.2.3 Long pushback
A long pushback instruction shall require aircraft to complete the pushback operation two stands away from where the pushback was commenced. This manoeuvre may be used when aircraft are vacating a stand to be used by another aircraft that is taxiing in.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Muscat Ground, OMA849, on stand 303 request pushback."

    **Controller**: "OMA849, Muscat Ground, long pushback approved, face East on T to finish abeam stand 305."

    **Pilot**: "Long pushback approved, facing East on T to finish abeam stand 305, OMA849."

### 3.2.3 Simultaneous pushback operations
Simultaneous pushbacks may be permitted from adjacent stands provided aircraft are instructed to manoeuver in accordance with 3.2.2 such that on completion of both aircraft’s pushback operation, they will be separated on the taxiway by two aircraft stands.

### 3.2.4 Pushback direction

- **Departing Runway 08L:**  
  - Aircraft parked on stands 3xx shall be instructed to *“FACE WEST”*.  
  - Aircraft on stands 201–203 may be instructed to *“FACE NORTH”* or *“FACE SOUTH”*, at the controller’s discretion, considering prevailing traffic conditions.

- **Departing Runway 26R:**  
  Aircraft parked on the north side of the main terminal (stands 2xx and 3xx) shall be instructed to *“FACE EAST”* or *“FACE NORTH”*, as appropriate based on stand position and traffic flow.

- **South Side Stands and Cargo Apron (Stands 4xx, 5xx, 6xx):**  
  Aircraft parked on the south side of the main terminal and those on the cargo apron shall be instructed to *“FACE WEST”*, unless an alternate orientation is required for efficient ground movement.

- **Southern Taxi-Out Stands (Below Runways 08R/26L):**  
  A majority of stands located on the southern side of the aerodrome, beneath runways 08R and 26L, are configured as taxi-out stands. Aircraft on these stands do **not** require pushback clearance and shall only request start-up clearance prior to taxi.

## 3.3 Departure taxi procedures
### 3.3.1 General departure taxi procedures
Except as specified in Section 3.6, departing aircraft shall be taxied via the taxiways closest to their assigned stands (i.e., Taxiways T, L, S, M, or H).

When taxiing aircraft to runway holding points, Ground shall ensure timely coordination and transfer of control to Tower. The transfer shall occur early enough to allow continuous taxi without requiring the aircraft to stop at the holding point.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "OMA601, request taxi."

    **Controller**: "OMA601, taxi holding point Y1, runway 08L, via UE and V."

    **Pilot**: "Taxi holding point Y1, runway 08L, via UE and V, OMA601."

To deconflict traffic, and to reduce the length of taxi clearances, intermediate holding points shall be used wherever possible.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "OMA601, request taxi."

    **Controller**: "OMA601, taxi via UE and V, hold short V3."

    **Pilot**: "Taxi via UE and V, hold short V3, OMA601."

### 3.3.2 Runway 08L Departure Taxi Procedures
The north and south sides of the terminal are connected by Taxiways **N** and **R**.

- Taxiway **R** is designated for **northbound** traffic.
- Taxiway **N** is designated for **southbound** traffic.  

Accordingly:

- Departing traffic from the north side shall taxi via **Taxiways L, H, and R** to the assigned departure runway.  
- Aircraft positioned **south of Taxiway F** shall taxi **northbound** via **Taxiways F, E4, and H**.

### 3.3.3 Runway 08R Departure Taxi Procedures
Traffic operating from aprons located south of Runway 08R/26L shall exit via the designated apron exit, taxi via **Taxiway A**, and cross Runway 08R/26L at **Intersection D1**. They shall then continue via **Taxiways E1, H**, and subsequent assigned routes as applicable.

**Taxiway V** shall be used by **departing aircraft** in all runway configurations.

This routing ensures organized traffic flow and minimizes the risk of ground movement conflicts.

!!! warning
    Controllers shall exercise heightened vigilance when taxiing aircraft to or from the aprons south of Runway 08R/26L. These aprons are connected to the main aerodrome layout by **a single intersection (D1)**, increasing the risk of head-on (nose-to-nose) conflicts. Strategic sequencing and timely coordination are essential.

### 3.3.4 Runway 26L Departure Taxi Procedures

### 3.3.5 Runway 26R Departure Taxi Procedures

## 3.4 Arrival taxi procedures
### 3.4.1 General arrival taxi procedures
Arriving aircraft shall not immediately be handed off by TWR. They must instead be given an initial taxi instruction onto W or V to keep traffic flowing. Therefore, GMC shall assign an arrival stand when they are on final approach.

Once the aircraft is handed off to GMC they may be taxied to their stand. Arrivals shall generally be taxied via the outside taxiways that are farthest away from stands.

In the 08L configuration, traffic vacating Y5 shall use taxiway W to their stand.

Arriving traffic headed to the south side of the terminal will taxi via N G and K to the stand.

Traffic going to the south side of the aerodrome (south of runway 08R/26L) will taxi via N H E1, D1. 

### 3.4.2 Runway 08L Arrival Taxi Procedures

### 3.4.3 Runway 08R Arrival Taxi Procedures

### 3.4.4 Runway 26L Arrival Taxi Procedures

### 3.4.5 Runway 26R Arrival Taxi Procedures

### 3.4.6 Stand allocation procedure
Aircraft shall be assigned stands automatically using the Ground Radar Plugin (GRplugin) system wherever possible. Muscat does not feature operator depended stands. So all passenger operators will get a random stand at the terminal assigned.

For cargo operators, there is a dedicated cargo apron on the east side of the airport at taxiway H. The south side of the airport is used by GA, VIP and military aircraft but not by commercial passenger airlines.

### 3.4.7 Stand restrictions
TBD

## 3.5 Low visibility operations (LVO)
As no active runway crossings are required during taxi, there are no specific additional operational procedures in place for low visibility conditions.

However, when Runway Visual Range (RVR) falls below 550 meters, departures are not permitted.

## 3.6 Designated areas of responsibility
Muscat has recently introduced a second ground position, meaning ground can be split into two positions if necessary: Ground North (GMC North) and South (GMC South). 
These positions are split in a horizontal line between the north-civil apron. For example, stands 1xx, 2xx and 3xx and their adjacent taxiways are controlled by GMC North and stands 4xx, 5xx and 6xx and their adjacent taxiways are controlled by GMC South. 

When both GMC North and GMC South are online, departing aircraft taxiing from the south side of the aerodrome via R shall be instructed by GMC South to taxi via R to hold short at R2, before being transferred to GMC North.
Similarly, arriving traffic taxiing from the north to the south side of the aerodrome shall be instructed to taxi via N to hold short at N1, before being transferred to GMC South. 
These points signify the boundaries of the areas of responsibility for Muscat Ground.
