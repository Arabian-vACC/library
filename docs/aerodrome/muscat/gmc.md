# 4. Ground Movement Procedures
## 4.1 General Provisions
The Ground Movement Controller (GMC) is responsible for managing aircraft movements on all aerodrome movement areas except for runways and their associated Taxiways. Departing aircraft are given pushback instructions and instructions to taxi to the runway holding point. Arriving aircraft are assigned a stand and instructed to taxi as appropriate.

## 4.2 Departure Pushback Procedures
### 4.2.1 General Pushback Procedures
When aircraft have been handed off from GMP, they shall be fully ready for pushback. Assuming no obstructions, they shall be instructed to push back immediately. If an aircraft is cleared for push and start but does not begin pushing within 2-5 minutes, the pushback clearance is canceled.

- **Transponders** must remain **on standby** while on the apron, unless **explicitly approved by ATC**.
- **Departing aircraft** shall keep transponders on **standby** until **take-off clearance** is issued.
- **ADS-B** must be **activated prior to startup** for all departing aircraft from **Muscat International Airport (OOMS)**.

Pushback direction is based primarily on aircraft location and runway configuration. 

A pushback clearance must be a variant of those provided in 4.2.2 and include an instruction to “FACE NORTH”, “FACE EAST", “FACE SOUTH" or “FACE WEST” as appropriate with the Taxiway to push onto.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Muscat Ground, OMA601, on stand 105 request pushback."

    **Controller**: "OMA601, Muscat Ground, pushback approved, face North on S."

    **Pilot**: "Pushback approved, facing North on S, OMA601."

Conditional pushback instructions may also be issued if an aircraft is taxiing behind another waiting for pushback.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Muscat Ground, OMA667, on stand 201 request pushback."

    **Controller**: "OMA667, Muscat Ground, behind the company 737 passing left to right, pushback approved, face North on UE."

    **Pilot**: "After the company 737 passes from left to right, pushback approved, facing North on UE, OMA667."

### 4.2.2 Pushback Types
#### 4.2.2.1 Standard Pushback
This type will normally have the aircraft stop abeam the adjacent stand. The phraseology for this type of pushback is identical to the pushback phraseology as provided in 4.2.1.

#### 4.2.2.2 Short Pushback
A short pushback instruction shall require the aircraft to complete the pushback abeam the current stand such that the adjacent stand will not be blocked.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Muscat Ground, OMA643, on stand 303 request pushback."

    **Controller**: "OMA643, Muscat Ground, short pushback approved, face East on T to finish abeam stand 303."

    **Pilot**: "Short pushback approved, facing East on T to finish abeam stand 303, OMA643."

#### 4.2.2.3 Long Pushback
A long pushback instruction shall require aircraft to complete the pushback operation two stands away from where the pushback was commenced. This manoeuvre may be used when aircraft are vacating a stand to be used by another aircraft that is taxiing in.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Muscat Ground, OMA849, on stand 303 request pushback."

    **Controller**: "OMA849, Muscat Ground, long pushback approved, face East on T to finish abeam stand 305."

    **Pilot**: "Long pushback approved, facing East on T to finish abeam stand 305, OMA849."

### 4.2.3 Simultaneous Pushback Operations
Simultaneous pushbacks may be permitted from adjacent stands provided aircraft are instructed to manoeuver in accordance with 4.2.2 such that on completion of both aircraft’s pushback operation, they will be separated on the Taxiway by two aircraft stands.

## 4.3 Departure Taxi Procedures
### 4.3.1 General Departure Taxi Procedures
Except as specified in Section 3.6, departing aircraft shall be taxied via the Taxiways closest to their assigned stands.

When taxiing aircraft to runway holding points, Ground shall ensure timely coordination and transfer of control to Tower. The transfer shall occur early enough to allow continuous taxi without requiring the aircraft to stop at the holding point.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "OMA601, request taxi."

    **Controller**: "OMA601, taxi holding point Y1, runway 08L, via UE and V."

    **Pilot**: "Taxi holding point Y1, runway 08L, via UE and V, OMA601."

To deconflict traffic, and to reduce the length of taxi clearances, intermediate holding points shall be used wherever possible.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "OMA601, request taxi."

    **Controller**: "OMA601, taxi via UE and V, hold short V3."

    **Pilot**: "Taxi via UE and V, hold short V3, OMA601."

!!! warning
    Controllers shall exercise heightened vigilance when taxiing aircraft to or from the aprons south of Runway 08R/26L. These aprons are connected to the main aerodrome layout by **a single intersection (D1)**, increasing the risk of head-on (nose-to-nose) conflicts. Strategic sequencing and timely coordination are essential.

## 4.4 Arrival Taxi Procedures
### 4.4.1 General Arrival Taxi Procedures
Arriving aircraft should not be handed off by AIR immediately upon landing. Instead, they must receive initial taxi instructions to Taxiways G, V, or W to maintain traffic flow.  

Aircraft must avoid stopping on rapid exit Taxiways and should proceed as follows, unless otherwise directed by the tower:  

- **Vacating 08L:** Continue taxiing via Taxiway W.  
- **Vacating 08R:** Continue taxiing via Taxiway G or A.
- **Vacating 26L:** Continue taxiing via V and hold short Intermediate Holding Point V2.  
- **Vacating 26R:** Continue taxiing via Taxiway G or A.

Therefore, GMC should assign an arrival stand to aircraft as soon as they appear on the arrival list, as this facilitates the assignment of the arrival runway for terminal controllers.  

Once the aircraft is handed off to GMC, they can be directed to their assigned stand.

### 4.4.6 Stand Allocation Procedure
Stand assignments shall be managed automatically via the Ground Radar Plugin (GRplugin) system wherever feasible.

Muscat International Airport does not utilize operator-specific stands. As such, all passenger operators shall be assigned a stand at the terminal on a randomized basis, with priority given to stands at the new passenger terminal for all commercial passenger flights.

Cargo operators shall be assigned stands on the dedicated cargo apron, located on the east side of the airport near Taxiway H.

The south side of the airport is reserved for General Aviation (GA), VIP, and military operations. These aprons are not used for commercial passenger aircraft.

## 4.5 Low Visibility Operations (LVO)
### 4.5.1 LVO Taxi Routes
As no active runway crossings are required during taxi, there are no specific additional operational procedures in place for low visibility conditions.

However, when Runway Visual Range (RVR) falls below 550 meters, departures are not permitted.

## 4.6 Designated Areas of Responsibility
### 4.6.1 GMC Positions
Muscat has recently introduced a second ground position, allowing ground control to be split into two positions when necessary: Ground North (GMC 1) and Ground South (GMC 2).

When both GMC 1 and GMC 2 are online, departing aircraft taxiing from the south side of the aerodrome via Taxiway R shall be instructed by GMC 2 to taxi via R to hold short at Taxiway V, before being transferred to GMC 1 (Ground North).
 
Similarly, arriving aircraft taxiing from the north to the south side of the aerodrome shall be instructed to taxi via Taxiway N to hold short at Taxiway H, before being transferred to GMC 2 (Ground South).

#### 4.6.1.1 GMC 1 Responsibilities  
GMC 1 manages aircraft movements in the following areas and their associated taxiways:  
- North of the Main Concourse  

#### 4.6.1.2 GMC 2 Responsibilities  
GMC 2 manages aircraft movements in the following areas and their associated taxiways:  
- South of the Main Concourse  
- Old Terminal, Royal Apron, Police Apron, RAFO Apron, MRO Apron

### 4.6.2 Handoff Procedures
When transferring control between controllers, aircraft must not be cleared beyond the current controller’s designated area of responsibility unless prior coordination has been completed with the next controller. Hold short instructions may be issued to meet this requirement.

### 4.6.3 Splitting Procedure
When a single GMC controller is online, they shall manage all surface movement areas from the GMC 1 position. 

Unless otherwise authorized by Arabian vACC staff, GMP (Muscat Clearance Delivery) must be online before two GMC (Muscat Ground) positions can be opened.

If GMP is not online, GMC shall assume the responsibilities of the lower controller.
