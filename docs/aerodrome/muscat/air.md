# 5. Air Control Procedures
## 5.1 General Provisions
Air Control (AIR) is responsible for all aerodrome movements on runways and their associated taxiways. AIR shall also ensure separation between IFR aircraft that are arriving at and departing the aerodrome, as well as provide traffic information to VFR aircraft operating within the aerodrome control zone.

## 5.2 Preferential Runways
The preferred calm wind configuration is using runway 26R, which may be utilized with a tailwind of up to 5 knots. If this configuration is not feasible due to wind conditions or other factors, runway 08L shall be used instead.

!!! warning
    Runway 08R/26L is fully operational in the real world. However, in most simulator sceneries, this runway is either nonexistent or still under construction. Therefore, by default, this runway shall not be used and may only be assigned when requested by the pilot and confirmed to be available in their scenery.

## 5.3 Departure Procedures
Runway 08L/26R has three departure points for each configuration. The standard departure points are full-length for each runway. There is no expected performance difference between Y1 and Y2, or between Y7 and Y8, allowing either to be assigned to optimize departure flow. Y3 and Y6 are intersection departure points and shall only be assigned after the pilot confirms that the aircraft’s performance is adequate.

### 5.3.2 Line Up Clearances
Conditional line up instructions shall include the traffic that the aircraft is to follow, as well as the word “behind” at the beginning and end of the transmission. It is recommended to only have a maximum of two conditional line up clearances active at one i.e., one aircraft lining up behind a departure, and another aircraft lining up behind them.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "OMA661, behind the departing company Boeing 787, via Y2, line up and wait runway 08L behind."

If aircraft have not yet reached the holding point where they are expected to line up at, ATC shall reiterate the cleared holding point.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "OMA661, via Y2, line up and wait runway 08L."

### 5.3.3 Take-off Clearances
Aircraft will be cleared for takeoff once adequate separation is ensured as outlined in sections 5.3.4 and 5.6. At the time of takeoff clearance, aircraft will be assigned their airborne frequency, for Muscat Radar or the next available station, such as Muscat Control North. If none of these stations are online, aircraft will be instructed to monitor UNICOM 122.8.

!!! example
   **Controller:** "OMA643, airborne contact Muscat Radar 121.200, wind 330 degrees 7 knots, runway 26L, cleared for take-off."

### 5.3.4 Separation Requirements
#### 5.3.4.1 General
Aircraft shall be separated on departure in accordance with standard IFR departure separation minima.

- A minimum separation of **2 minutes** shall be applied between successive aircraft departing with the same Muscat FIR exit point.  
- If two aircraft are departing with the **same Muscat FIR exit point** *and* are filed at the **same cruising level**, a minimum of **3 minutes** separation shall be ensured.

#### 5.3.4.3 Low visibility and IMC
During low visibility operations and during IMC, departing aircraft shall not be cleared for take-off when there is an arriving aircraft within **4 NM** of the landing runway threshold.

### 5.3.5 IFR Handoff Procedure
Departing IFR aircraft shall be transferred to **Muscat Approach**. If the TMA controller is not online, handoff shall be made to **Muscat Control**.

- Handoff shall be initiated **when the aircraft passes 1,000 ft**.  
- This ensures sufficient time for frequency change and helps prevent level-offs during the initial climb.

### 5.3.6 Stopping a Departure
Aircraft that have commenced their take-off roll may be instructed to stop immediately to avert a collision due to a runway incursion or any other dangerous situation. 

It must be noted though, that the instruction to stop must be given early enough such that the aircraft does not reach its decision speed. Therefore, aerodrome controllers must be vigilant and remain aware of the location of traffic at all times as well as runway incursion hotspots.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "FDB7WA, stop immediately, I say again stop immediately, truck entering the runway!"

For aircraft that have been given a take-off clearance, but have not yet started the roll, they shall be instructed to hold position and the take-off clearance must be cancelled along with the reason for cancellation.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "FDB7WA, hold position, cancel take-off, I say again cancel take-off, aircraft entering the runway, acknowledge."


## 5.4 Arrival Procedures
### 5.4.1 Preferred Exit Points
During periods of increased arrival or departure traffic, arriving aircraft are expected to vacate the runway via the designated **rapid exit taxiways**, as applicable to the runway in use.

The following taxiways serve as rapid exits:

- **Runway 08L/26R**: Y4, Y5
- **Runway 08R/26L**: E3, E4, E5, E6  

This procedure supports efficient runway occupancy time and maximizes traffic throughput.

### 5.4.2 Separation Requirements
#### 5.4.2.1 General
While the radar controllers are responsible for separating arriving aircraft, the AIR controller shall still ensure that minimum separation is maintained until the preceding aircraft crosses the runway threshold. 

#### 5.4.2.2 Speed control
If it is apparent that minimum separation may not exist as provided in 5.4.2.1, AIR may use a tactical reduction in aircraft speed.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "OMS236, reduce to final approach speed."

#### 5.4.2.3 Visual separation
Aircraft may be instructed to maintain own separation visually, if speed control alone will not resolve the conflict. This shall only be done in VMC and with agreement with the pilot. If no other solutions are practical, the succeeding aircraft shall be instructed to go around.

### 5.4.3 Go-around Instruction
#### 5.4.3.1 General go-around procedure
At any time should a runway become unsuitable for an aircraft landing, or separation minima is not met, aircraft shall be instructed to go-around.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "OMS236, go around, I say again, go around, acknowledge."

Once aircraft have acknowledged the instruction and are observed to be safely climbing away, they shall be handed off to the appropriate Doha Approach controller.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "OMS236, climb to 6,000 ft via standard missed approach, contact Muscat Approach on 121.200."

### 5.4.4 Arrival Taxi Procedures
In accordance with the taxi procedures laid down in 3.4, aircraft shall be provided an initial taxi clearance to ensure they are kept moving such that the rapid exit taxiway (RET) is clear for the next arrival.

The initial taxi shall include instructions to taxi “LEFT” or “RIGHT” onto the relevant taxiway as appropriate and hold at a suitable intermediate holding point.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "OMS236 taxi left onto V, hold short V2."

Once aircraft have been observed to be taxiing and completely clear of the RET, transfer of control shall be initiated to GMC provided there will be no conflicts with other arriving traffic.

## 5.5 VFR Procedures
The Muscat Control Zone (CTR) is designated as **Class C** airspace, unlike many other CTRs which are typically Class D. As a result, **Muscat Tower is responsible for providing separation between IFR and VFR traffic** within the CTR.

- **IFR vs VFR**: A minimum separation of **3 NM** shall be maintained, or greater if required by wake turbulence criteria.
- **VFR vs VFR**: Separation is **not required**; however, **traffic information shall be provided** to enhance situational awareness wherever possible.

### 5.5.1 VFR Departures
Once VFR aircraft are ready for departure, they shall be **cleared for take-off in sequence**. As aircraft begin their **crosswind turn**, the following actions shall be taken:

- **Reporting**: Pilots shall be instructed to **report leaving the control zone**, or to report at a relevant **Visual Reporting Point (VRP)** based on their route.

- **Exiting to Uncontrolled Airspace**: Aircraft exiting the Muscat CTR into **uncontrolled airspace** shall be instructed to:
  - **Remain outside controlled airspace**, and
  - **Monitor UNICOM** on the appropriate frequency.

- **Entering Muscat TMA**: Aircraft routing into the **Muscat TMA** shall be:
  - **Handed off to the Muscat TMA controller**, ideally **one minute before exiting the control zone**, to ensure a smooth transfer of responsibility.

### 5.5.2 VFR Traffic Remaining in the Circuit
AIR control is responsible for managing circuit traffic. Circuits must always be conducted to the north of the aerodrome at 1,000 ft.

Once aircraft are ready for departure, they should be cleared for take-off in sequence. As they begin their crosswind turn (the first turn after departure) they shall be instructed to report when they are on the downwind with their intentions.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "A4O-OAD, report downwind with intentions."

Aircraft may request either a touch and go (where the aircraft lands and immediately takes off), a stop and go (where the aircraft lands, comes to a complete stop on the runway, then takes off), a low approach (where the aircraft flies low over the runway without landing), or a full stop (where
the aircraft lands and vacates the runway).

Once AIR is aware of the aircraft’s request, they may be sequenced to the runway, with due consideration given to runway occupancy time.

Aircraft on the downwind should be passed the following information:

- Expected runway;
- Sequence;
- Traffic information, if applicable

!!! example
    **Controller**: "A4O-OAD, report downwind with intentions."

    **Controller**: "A4O-OAD, report final runway 08L, number 1."

    **Controller**: "A4O-OAD, runway 08L, cleared to land/touch and go/low approach."

Aircraft conducting a stop-and go shall be required to “REPORT READY FOR DEPARTURE”.

### 5.5.3 VFR Arrivals
Inbound VFR aircraft shall be instructed to contact AIR with enough time such that two-way radio communications has been established before aircraft enter the aerodrome control zone.

On first contact, AIR will pass instructions to enter the CTR, as well as any other pertinent information.

!!! example
    **Controller:** “A4O-OAD, Muscat Tower, Enter the Muscat Control zone via Cement Plant East, Runway 26R, 2,000 ft VFR, QNH 1017”

As VFR traffic approaches the aerodrome, they shall be issued **circuit joining instructions** appropriate to the current traffic conditions and runway in use.

- **Arrivals from the South**:
  - If traffic conditions permit, aircraft may be given a **direct base leg join** for the active runway.
  - If delays are anticipated or sequencing is required, aircraft shall be instructed to conduct a **midfield crossing** to join the **standard left-hand or right-hand circuit pattern** on the **north side of the aerodrome**, as appropriate.

Controllers shall ensure circuit traffic is properly sequenced and provided with timely traffic information to maintain safe separation.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "A4O-OAD, Muscat Tower, join right hand base runway 08L."

Aircraft may also be instructed to track towards a visual reporting point (VRP).

!!! example
    **Controller**: "A4O-OAD, Muscat Tower, track towards Cement Plant West, 2,000 ft VFR. Report one mile from Cement Plant West, QNH 1013."

VFR arrivals may be denied entry into the control zone during times of increased IFR arrival activity and instructed to hold outside controller airspace awaiting further instructions.

## 5.6 Low Visibility Operations (LVO)
### 5.6.1 Commencement of LVO
Low visibility operations (LVO) are commenced at Muscat when:

- The visibility is 1500 metres or less;
- The cloud base is 1000 feet or less,
- or whenever conditions are such that all of the manouvering area cannot be seen from the control tower

Runway crossings shall be kept to a minimum. Muscat is not approved for CAT II/III operations.

### 5.6.2 LVO Departure Procedures
During LVO, aircraft are required to depart from the full-length holding points. Intersection departures are not allowed under LVO conditions.

### 5.6.3 LVO Arrival Procedures
Arriving aircraft must report fully vacated.

## 5.7 Designated Areas of Responsibility
### 5.7.1 AIR Positions
AIR 1 is responsible for runway 08L/26R and all associated taxiways. AIR 2 is responsible for runway 08R/26L and all associated taxiways.

### 5.7.2 Handoff Procedure
Where transfer of control is to be made between aerodrome controllers, aircraft shall not be cleared to a point beyond the current controller’s designated zone of responsibility unless there has been
prior coordination with the next controller. Hold short instructions may be used to satisfy this requirement.

### 5.7.3 Splitting Procedure
Where there is only one controller, they shall cover all runways and associated airspace from the AIR 1 position.

Unless otherwise authorised by the Arabian vACC staff, GMP (Muscat Clearance Delivery) and at least one GMC (Muscat Ground) position must be online before two AIR (Muscat Tower) positions may be opened.
