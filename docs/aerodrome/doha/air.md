## 2.8 VFR aircraft
VFR flight activity should be planned in accordance to published VFR charts, specifically the “**OTBD: Helicopter Route**” & “**OTBD: VFR**” charts for traffic navigating within the CTR. GMP may use the appropriate charts as per the requirements of the pilot’s intentions in accordance with 2.8.1, 2.8.2 and 2.8.3. 

All aircraft returning from general training flying areas shall request joining instructions prior to leaving these areas.

#### 2.8.1.1 Suspension of the orange route
The orange route will be suspended under the following conditions:

- When the cloud ceiling is below 2000ft and/or visibility is less than 3500 m;
- During peak arrival periods and during independent parralel operations;
- Doha-Hamad supervisor for any other valid reasons suspends the route with at least 15 minutes notice to Doha;

#### 2.8.4.1 Arrival procedures
- Aircraft to contact Doha Tower at SML for clearance
- If more than two aircraft are requesting to return to Doha from the General Flying Area, they will be required to hold at ZUL for runway 33 or VLG for runway 15. Succeeding aircraft will be advised to remain clear of the CTR and standby for joining instructions.
  - Only one aircraft may hold at a time overhead ZUL and VLG.
  - No holding overhead ASP.
- Traffic arriving via ASP is independent of OTHH IFR traffic.
- Aircraft proceeding for right base runway 15 from VLG will maintain 1500 ft until established on the final approach to avoid infringing the restricted area over Amiri Diwan.
  - After establishing on the approach, touchdown may be expected approximately abeam intersection taxiway Q, with roll-out and vacating at intersection taxiway B or B1.
