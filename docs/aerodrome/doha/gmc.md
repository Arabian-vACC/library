# 4. Ground Movement Procedures
## 4.1 General Provisions
GMC is also responsible for managing aircraft movements on all aerodrome movement areas except for runways and their associated taxiways. Departing aircraft are given pushback instructions and instructions to taxi to the runway holding point. Arriving aircraft are assigned a stand and instructed to taxi as appropriate.

## 4.2 Pushback Procedures 
### 4.2.1 General pushback procedures
Assuming no obstructions, aircraft shall be instructed to push back immediately. 

Aircraft requesting pushback without squawking their assigned transponder code or having their transponder turned on will be instructed to hold position and set the correct code. They must not be cleared to move until this is done.

Pushback direction is based primarily on aircraft location and runway configuration.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Doha Ground, QQE101, at stand A8 request push and start."

    **Controller**: "QQE101, stand A8, push and start approved face south."

    **Pilot**: "Push and start approved face south, QQE101."

Conditional pushback instructions may also be issued if an aircraft is taxiing behind another waiting for pushback.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Doha Ground, TCM4TM, on stand A3 request pushback."

    **Controller**: "TCM4TM, behind the Qatar Executive Gulfstream 650 passing right to left, push and start approved, face south."

    **Pilot**: "After the Qatar Executive Gulfstream 650 passes from right to left, push and start approved, face south, TCM4TM."

### 4.2.2 Pushback restrictions
Simultaneous pushback operations are not permitted into the same alleyway for stands G1 to G4 and W6 to W7.

For all other stands, aircraft shall be separated by at least two aircraft stands before they are given simultaneous pushback.

## 4.3 Departure taxi procedures
### 4.3.1 General departure taxi procedures
Where aircraft are taxied to runway holding points, transfer of control to AIR shall be made early enough such that the aircraft is not required to stop its taxi.

To deconflict traffic, and to reduce the length of taxi clearances, hold short instructions shall be used wherever possible.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Doha Ground, TCM4TM, request taxi."

    **Controller**: "TCM4TM, taxi via D, hold short of B."

    **Pilot**: "Taxi via D, hold short of B, TCM4TM."

### 4.3.2 Runway 33 departure taxi procedures
When departing from runway 33, aircraft taxiing from the west side of the aerodrome will be instructed to taxi via taxiway D to holding points F or G. 

Aircraft on the east side will be directed to taxi to holding point B1 for crossing, then proceed via taxiway D to holding points F or G. 

Extreme caution must be exercised between taxiways D and C, as this area is a rapid exit taxiway for vacating aircraft. The same caution applies between taxiways C1 and D1.

### 4.3.3 Runway 15 departure taxi procedures
When departing from runway 15, aircraft taxiing from the west side of the aerodrome will be directed to taxi via taxiway D to holding point A. 

Aircraft on the east side will be instructed to taxi to holding point B1 for crossing, then continue via taxiway D to holding point A. 

If an aircraft requires a full-length departure and backtracking, it can request this after being handed over to the tower.

## 4.4 Arrival taxi procedures
### 4.4.1 General arrival taxi procedures
GMC shall assign an arrival stand to the aircraft when they are on final approach.

Once the aircraft is handed off to GMC, they shall be taxied to their stand in accordance with the procedures laid down in 4.4.4.

(See 4.2)

### 4.4.2 Runway 33 arrival taxi procedures
Aircraft shall vacate on the respective rapid exit taxiways such as C or C1 and are then handed off to GMC.

Aircraft shall be taxied via D or D1 to the appropriate stand.

### 4.4.3 Runway 15 arrival taxi procedures
Aircraft shall vacate via E1 or utilize the turning loop available to then vacate via C1 or C when able. Once they have vacated the runway they are then handed off to GMC.

Aircraft shall be taxied via D or D1 to the appropriate stand.

### 4.4.4 Stand allocation procedures
Aircraft shall be assigned stands automatically using Ground Radar Plugin Stand Assigner. If this is not possible, aircraft shall manually be assigned a stand in accordance with the following procedure:

|  Stand(s)  |               Operator               |
|:----------:|:------------------------------------:|
|  A1 to A6  |                 VIP(s)               |
|  A9 to A18 |             Low-cost, QTR            |
|  G1 to G4  | General Aviation, Corporate Aviation |
|  W6 to W7  | General Aviation, Corporate Aviation |
|  C1 to C9  |               QTR, QQE               |
|  E1 to E24 |                  QTR                 |
| E32 to E37 |                  QTR                 |
| E25 to E27 |                  QQE                 |
| E29 to E31 |              Maintenance             |

### 4.4.5 Stand restrictions
Stands A1 to A18 can accommodate aircraft up to code E. Stands with an "N" or "S" designator have specific handling limitations and are restricted to aircraft up to code C. 

Stands G1 to G4, as well as W6 and W7, are limited to code A. 

Stands E1 to E37 support aircraft up to code E, while those with an "L" or "R" designator have handling restrictions up to code C. 

Stands C1 to C9 are suitable for aircraft up to code C.

## 4.5 Low visibility operations (LVO)
### 4.5.1 LVO taxi routes
When Low Visibility Operations (LVO) are in effect, all taxiways are approved for LVO, with no restrictions.

Runway 33 is the only CAT II/III approved runway and must be used during LVO conditions (4.6.2).

## 4.6 Designated areas of responsibility
### 4.6.1 GMC positions
GMC is responsible for all aprons and associated taxiways.

(See 2.2)

### 4.6.2 Handoff procedure
Where transfer of control is to be made between controllers, aircraft shall not be cleared to a point beyond the current controllerâ€™s designated zone of responsibility unless there has been prior coordination with the next controller. Hold short instructions may be used to satisfy this requirement.
