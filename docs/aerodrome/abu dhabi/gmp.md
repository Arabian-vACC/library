# 2. Ground Movement Planner ("Abu Dhabi Delivery")
## 2.1 General provisions
Airways clearance/Ground Movement Planner (GMP) is responsible for validating routes and shall provide IFR clearance to departing aircraft. The controller shall assign the correct departure procedure to the aircraft based on the first point that is filed on the flight plan.


Where the flight plan contains an invalid route, level or departure procedure, GMP must ensure that the error is corrected before the aircraft is given its clearance.


GMP is also responsible for minimizing taxiway delays and taxiway congestion for departing aircraft. During times of increased departure activity, aircraft are held at the gate to save fuel and lessen taxiway congestion.

## 2.2 Departure clearance
### 2.2.1 General
GMP is responsible for issuing clearances for departing aircraft. Pilots may be expected to report the following information on first contact: 

-	Callsign;
-	Aircraft type; 
-	Parking stand;
-	Reporting “Ready to Push and Start”

GMP shall instruct pilots to monitor the appropriate Ground Movement Controller (GMC) frequency as per the pilot's location and standby for ATC call.


GMC shall inform aircraft that are ready for pushback of any delay exceeding 5 minutes and provide an estimate. If no contact is made by ATC after 5 minutes of monitoring pilots shall contact Ground Movement Control to receive an estimate for pushback and start.


To facilitate the most expeditious movement of ready aircraft, pilots not ready to pushback and start when instructed to do so by ATC shall expect to wait for further pushback instructions.

### 2.2.2 Information contained in a departure clearance
An IFR clearance shall be in the following format:

-	Callsign;
-	Destination;
-	Departure procedure;
-	Initially cleared altitude;
-	Departure frequency;
-	Assigned SSR code

Aircraft shall be instructed to change frequency after departure in the following manner:

| Runway Configuration | Handoff Station |
|:--------------------:|:---------------:|
|      31s             |    APP W        |
|      13s             |    APP C        |

</figure>

When APP W is offline all handoffs shall be to APP C or as appropriate.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Abu Dhabi Delivery, ETD11 SUPER, type A380, stand 622, Information A, requesting IFR clearance to London, fully ready for push and start."
    
    **ATC**: "ETD11, Abu Dhabi Delivery, cleared to London via DAXIB 1K, maintain altitude 5000ft, when airborne contact Abu Dhabi Radar on 128.100, Squawk 3432."
    
    **Pilot**: "Cleared to London via DAXIB 1K, maintain altitude 5000ft, when airborne contact Abu Dhabi Radar on 128.100, Squawk 3432, ETD11."

    **ATC**: ETD11, readback correct. Information A current, QNH1013, Monitor Abu Dhabi Ground on 120.425"
    
GMP must obtain a full readback of the clearance. If the pilot does not report the current ATIS letter on first contact, GMP shall pass the current ATIS letter and QNH.

GMP must obtain a full readback of the clearance. If the pilot does not report the current ATIS letter on first contact, GMP shall pass the current ATIS letter and QNH.

### 2.2.3 Datalink clearance (DCL)

Aircraft clearance may also be delivered by DCL. This type of clearance reduces controller workload and frequency congestion. For suitably equipped aircraft, this will be through the ACARS system on board the aircraft.


!!!info
    Controllers shall ensure that DCL is available to be used at all times.
