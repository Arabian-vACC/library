# 5. Air Control Procedures
## 5.1 General provisions

Air Control (AIR) is responsible for all aerodrome movements on runways and their associated taxiways. AIR shall also ensure separation between IFR and VFR aircraft that are arriving at and
departing the aerodrome, as well as VFR aircraft operating within the aerodrome control zone.

## 5.2 Runway configuration
### 5.2.1 Simultaneous operation of instrument runways (SOIR)
The Abu Dhabi International Airport runways are 2,000 metres apart and comply with ICAO requirements for Simultaneous Operations of Instrument Runways (SOIR).
Segregated Runway Operations, i.e. one runway exclusively for arrivals and one exclusively for departures, are normally in use during busy arrival and departure times.

- Dependent Parallel Instrument Approaches shall be used as per ICAO Doc 9643 SOIR Mode 2 during peak arrival times and at other times as required by ATC with minimum 3 NM separation.
- During periods of reduced traffic demand, single runway, mixed-mode operations are used.
- During inbound peak-hours aircraft can expect to be vectored to either of the parallel runways to optimize the arrival sequence.
- ATIS will transmit “PARALLEL APPROACHES IN PROGRESS. PRIMARY ARRIVAL RUNWAY IS [IDENTIFIER FOR MAIN LANDING RUNWAY].” during peak arrival times when both runways are being used for arrivals.
- Pilots should exercise caution when selecting the ILS frequency.
- Pilots requiring the use of runway 13L / 31R for aircraft performance reasons outside of the times when Parallel Runway Operations are in use should advise ATC at the earliest opportunity. 
- Efforts will be made to make runway 13L / 31R available; however, delay may be experienced as returning this runway to service may take in excess of 15 minutes.
- Runway 13L / 31R should not be assumed to be available as a diversion alternate to runway 13R / 31L.

During SOIR pilots should take special care to comply with all ATC instructions due to:

- Aircraft landing runway 13L / 31R will be required to cross runway 13R / 31L to access parking stands.
- Military aircraft operating from OMAA north of runway 13L / 31R will be required to cross runway 13L / 31R to facilitate access to and from the military apron.
- Military aircraft can be expected to depart from runway 13L / 31R and arrival aircraft shouldbe aware that there may be departing traffic with possible increased arrival spacing to facilitate.


During SOIR, in the event of a blockage/unserviceability on the arrival runway, ATC will initiate single runway, mixed-mode operations and reposition aircraft to the available runway accordingly.

Training flights will not be facilitated at Abu Dhabi International Airport during parallel runway Operations.

## 5.3 Departure procedures
### 5.3.1 Standard departure points
<figure markdown>
| Runway | Standard departure points |
|:------:|:-------------------------:|
| 31R    | A16/A17/A18 (A14 for narrow body) |
| 31L    | D11/E15 (D9 for narrow body)  |
| 13L    | A1/A2/A3                  |
| 13R    | D1/E2                     |

  <figcaption>Table 5-1: Standard departure points</figcaption>
</figure>

### 5.3.2 Line up clearances
Conditional line up instructions must also include the traffic that the aircraft is to follow, as well as the word “behind” at the beginning and end of the transmission.
It is suggested to only have a maximum of two conditional line up clearances active at one i.e. one aircraft lining up behind a departure, and another aircraft lining up behind them.

!!! example
    **Controller**: “SWR243, Behind the departing Etihad A380, via E15 line up, runway 31L behind.
	
If aircraft have not yet reached the holding point where they are expected to line up at, ATC shall reiterate the cleared holding point.

!!! example
    **Controller**: “ETD11K, via E15, line up runway 31L”
	
### 5.3.3 Take-off clearances
Aircraft shall be cleared for take-off once adequate separation exists as provided in 5.3.4 and 5.5.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "ETD11K, Wind 330 degrees 7 knots, runway 31R, cleared for take-off"

### 5.3.4 Separation requirements
#### 5.3.4.1 General
Aircraft shall be separated on departure in compliance with standard IFR departure separation minima, wake turbulence separation requirements or as provided in 5.5 where applicable.

Except as provided in 5.3.4.2, succeeding aircraft on the same SID shall be separated by a minimum of 2 minutes.

VFR aircraft may be instructed to maintain visual separation with preceding aircraft and given a take- off clearance if no wake turbulence separation minima exists.

#### 5.3.4.2 Muscat FIR flow control procedure
Special flow control procedures are required for traffic entering the Muscat FIR via certain entry points after departure from UAE airports.

During off-peak times, this separation minima may be disregarded, and standard separation minima of 2 minutes may be applied provided it is not done for more than two successive departures.

|  SID  | FIR exit point | Longitudinal separation |
|:-----:|:--------------:|-------------------------|
| ANVIX |      TARDI     | 3 minutes               |
| IVURO |   LALDO/GOMTA  | 3 minutes               |
<figure markdown>
  <figcaption>Table 5-2: Flow control procedures for traffic entering the Muscat FIR</figcaption>
</figure>

#### 5.3.4.3 Low visibility and IMC
During low visibility operations and during IMC, departing aircraft shall not be cleared for take-off when there is an arriving aircraft within **4 NM** of the landing runway threshold.

### 5.3.5 IFR handoff procedure
Auto handoffs are utilised at Abu Dhabi. Once airborne, pilots are expected to contact the appropriate departure frequency. Pilots are provided with their departure frequency during clearance by the GMP controller. For further details, please refer to ***section 3.2.2***

### 5.3.6 Stopping a departure
Aircraft that have commenced their take-off roll may be instructed to stop immediately to avert a collision due to a runway incursion or any other dangerous situation. 

It must be noted though, that the instruction to stop must be given early enough such that the aircraft does not reach its decision speed. Therefore, aerodrome controllers must be vigilant and remain aware of the location of traffic at all times as well as runway incursion hotspots.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "ETD1KM, stop immediately, I say again stop immediately, truck entering the runway!"

For aircraft that have been given a take-off clearance, but have not yet started the roll, they shall be instructed to hold position and the take-off clearance must be cancelled along with the reason for cancellation.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "ETD687, hold position, cancel take-off, I say again cancel take-off, aircraft entering the runway, acknowledge."

## 5.4 Arrival Procedures
### 5.4.1 Preferred exit points
Pilots should vacate using the first convenient rapid exit taxiway unless an exit point is specified by the AIR controller.

Pilots shall taxi beyond the stop bar, and shall be instructed by the AIR controller on to the next taxiway as outlined in the taxi procedures ***(see 7.2)*** and then be transferred to the appropriate GMC controller ***(see 2.2).***

### 5.4.2 Separation requirements
#### 5.4.2.1 General
While the radar controllers are responsible for separating arriving aircraft, the AIR controller shall still ensure that minimum separation is maintained until the preceding aircraft crosses the runway threshold. 

#### 5.4.2.2 Speed control
If it is apparent that minimum separation may not exist as provided in 5.4.2.1, AIR may use a tactical reduction in aircraft speed.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "ETD1C, reduce to final approach speed."

#### 5.4.2.3 Visual separation
Aircraft may be instructed to maintain own separation visually, if speed control alone will not resolve the conflict. This shall only be done in VMC and with agreement with the pilot. If no other solutions are practical, the succeeding aircraft shall be instructed to go around.

### 5.4.3 Go-around instruction
At any time should a runway become unsuitable for an aircraft landing, or separation minima is not met, aircraft shall be instructed to go-around. All go around procedures have an altitude of 4000 ft.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "ETD23, go around, I say again, go around, acknowledge."

Once aircraft have acknowledged the instruction and are observed to be safely climbing away, they shall be handed off to departure control.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "ETD23, climb to 4000ft via standard missed approach, contact Dubai Departures 121.025."

### 5.4.4 Arrival taxi procedures
In accordance with the taxi procedures laid down in 4.4, aircraft shall be provided an initial taxi clearance to ensure they are kept moving such that the rapid exit taxiway (RET) is clear for the next arrival.

The initial taxi shall include instructions to taxi “LEFT” or “RIGHT” onto the relevant taxiway as appropriate and hold at a suitable intermediate holding point.

Once aircraft have been observed to be taxiing and completely clear of the RET, transfer of control shall be initiated to GMC provided there will be no conflicts with other arriving traffic.

## 5.5 Reduced runway separation minima (RRSM)
### 5.5.1 Conditions for the application of RRSM
Reduced runway separation may be applied at any time during day or night between:

- A departing aircraft and a succeeding aircraft using a single runway; or
- Two successive landing aircraft; or
- Two successive departing aircraft.

The following conditions must apply:

- The tailwind component does not exceed 5 knots at the landing threshold and there are no pilots reports of wind shear;
- Meteorological visibility is equal to or greater than 5000 metres and cloud ceiling is not less than 1000 ft. The AIR controller should be satisfied that the following aircraft will be able to observe the relevant traffic completely and continuously;
- Traffic information is provided to the crew of the succeeding aircraft;
- The runway is dry and there is no evidence that braking action will be adversely affected;
- The AIR controller is able to assess separation visually or by radar-derived information; 
- Suitable landmarks and markers on the surface surveillance system shall be available to assist the controller in assessing separation between aircraft;
- Wake turbulence separation minima shall be applied;
- Minimum separation continues to exist between two departing aircraft immediately after departure of the second aircraft;
- The pilot of an arriving aircraft is advised of the exit point where they are expected to vacate.

### 5.5.2 RRSM Procedure
#### 5.5.2.1 Landing following landing
When the runway‐in‐use is temporarily occupied by other traffic, landing clearance may be issued to an arriving aircraft, provided that the controller has reasonable assurance that the following separation criteria will be met when the landing aircraft crosses the runway threshold of:

- **Runway 13L/31R**:
    - The preceding landing aircraft has landed and has vacated the runway; or has passed a point at least 2400 metres from the threshold of the runway (abeam taxiway Z1 for 13L; midway between A8 and A10 for 31R); and is in motion and will vacate the runway without stopping and/or backtracking

- **Runway 13R/31L**:
    - The preceding landing aircraft has landed and has vacated the runway; or has passed a point at least 2400 metres from the threshold of the runway (intersection of E10 and E12 for 13R; intersection of E7 and E8 for 31L); and is in motion and will vacate the runway without stopping and/or backtracking.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "ETD91, 777 vacating at A8, [surface] wind 260 degrees 5 knots, runway 31R, cleared to land."

#### 5.5.2.2 Landing following departure
When the runway‐in‐use is temporarily occupied by other traffic, landing clearance may be issued to an arriving aircraft, provided that the controller has reasonable assurance that the following separation distances/criteria will be met when the landing aircraft crosses the runway threshold:

- **Runway 13L/31R**:
    - The preceding departing aircraft will be airborne and has passed a point at least 2400 M from the threshold of the runway (abeam taxiway Z1 for 13L; midway between A8 and A10 for 31R)

- **Runway 13R/31L**:
    - The preceding departing aircraft will be airborne and has passed a point at least 2400m from the threshold of the runway (intersection of E10 and E12 for 13R; intersection of E7 and E8 for 31L)

!!! example
    **Controller**: "FDX4215, 777 departing ahead, [surface] wind 330 degrees 15 knots, runway 31R, cleared to land."

#### 5.5.2.3 Departure following departure
Take‐off clearance may be issued to a departing aircraft, commencing its take‐off roll from full length, before the preceding departure has passed the upwind end of the runway; provided:

- **Runway 13L/31R**:
    - The preceding departing aircraft will be airborne and has passed a point at least 2400 M from the threshold of the runway (abeam taxiway Z1 for 13L; midway between A8 and A10 for 31R), and minimum separation continues to exist, constant or increasing, between the two departing aircraft immediately after take‐off of the second aircraft.

- **Runway 13R/31L**:
    - The preceding departing aircraft will be airborne and has passed a point at least 2400m from the threshold of the runway (intersection of E10 and E12 for 13R; intersection of E7 and E8 for 31L), and minimum separation continues to exist, constant or increasing, between the two departing aircraft immediately after take‐off of the second aircraft.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "BOX514, 737 departing ahead, [surface] wind 120 degrees 7 knots, runway 13L, cleared for take-off."


## 5.6 VFR procedures
### 5.6.1 VFR departures
Once VFR aircraft are ready for departure, they shall be cleared for take-off in sequence. As they begin their crosswind turn (the first turn after departure) they shall be instructed to report leaving the control zone.

Once aircraft are clear of the zone, they shall be instructed to remain outside controlled airspace and monitor advisory frequency.

Aircraft climbing into controlled airspace shall be handed off to departure control.


### 5.6.2 VFR traffic remaining in the circuit
AIR control is responsible for managing circuit traffic. Circuits must always be conducted to the south of the aerodrome. 

Circuits shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures laid down in 2.8.3.

Once aircraft are ready for departure, they shall be cleared for take-off in sequence. As they begin their crosswind turn (the first turn after departure) they shall be instructed to report when they are on the downwind with their intentions.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "ATA, report downwind with intentions."

Aircraft may request either a touch and go (where the aircraft lands and immediately takes off), a stop and go (where the aircraft lands, comes to a complete stop on the runway, then takes off), a low approach (where the aircraft flies low over the runway without landing), or a full stop (where the aircraft lands and vacates the runway).

Once AIR is aware of the aircraft’s request, they may be sequenced to the runway, with due consideration given to runway occupancy time.

Aircraft on the downwind shall be passed the following information:

- Expected runway;
- Sequence;
- Traffic information, if applicable

!!! example
    **Controller**: "ATA, report final runway 31R, number 1."

    **Controller**: "ATA, runway 31R, cleared to land/touch and go/low approach."

Aircraft conducting a stop-and go shall be required to “REPORT READY FOR DEPARTURE”.

### 5.6.3 VFR arrivals
Inbound VFR aircraft shall be instructed to contact AIR with enough time such that two-way radio communications has been established before aircraft enter the aerodrome control zone. 

On first contact, AIR will pass circuit joining instructions, as well as any other pertinent information.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "A6-BGA, Abu Dhabi Tower, join left hand downwind runway 31L, 1000ft VFR, QNH 1017."

Aircraft may also be instructed to track towards a visual reporting point (VRP).

!!! example
    **Controller**: "A6-BGA, Abu Dhabi Tower, track towards Al Falah Centre, 1000ft VFR. Report one mile from Al Falah Centre, QNH 1007."

VFR arrivals may be denied entry into the control zone during times of increased IFR arrival activity and instructed to hold outside controller airspace awaiting further instructions.

## 5.7 Low visibility operations (LVO)
### 5.7.1 Commencement of LVO
Low visibility safeguards shall be initiated when the reported metorological visibility is below 2500 M or the reported cloud base is below 500 ft. 

Low visibility operations shall be in force when the visibility or RVR is below 550 M or ceiling is below 200 ft.

Runways 31L and 31R/13L are suitable for CAT IIIB operations with minimum runway visual range of 50 M. 

### 5.7.2 LVO departure procedures
During LVO procedures, aircraft are required to use full length departures

| Runway | Holding Point |
|:------:|:-------------:|
| 31L    | E15/D11       |
| 31R    | A17           |
| 13L    | A2            |

</figure>

## 5.8 Designated areas of responsibility
### 5.8.1 AIR positions
Abu Dhabi has two AIR positions, AIR 1 and AIR 2. 

AIR 1 controls runway 31L/13R as well as all associated exit taxiways and runway holding points. AIR 2 controls runway 31R/13L as well as all associated exit taxiways and runway holding points. 

The airspace directly around the airport is split directly through the centre of the aerodrome (a line of runway heading, approximately intersecting the Control Tower and the midpoint between L2 and L3). The northern half is delegated to AIR2, while the southern half is delegated to AIR 1. 

(See 2.2)

### 5.8.2 Handoff procedure
Where transfer of control is to be made between aerodrome controllers, aircraft shall not be cleared to a point beyond the current controller’s designated zone of responsibility unless there has been prior coordination with the next controller. Intermediate holding points may be used to satisfy this requirement.
For runway crossings, the crossing instruction must only be issued by the designated AIR controller for the respective runway unless prior coordination has been conducted.

### 5.8.3 Splitting procedure
Where there is only one controller, they shall cover all runways and associated airspace from the AIR 1 position. 

Unless otherwise authorised by the Arabian vACC staff, GMP (Abu Dhabi Delivery) and at least one GMC (Abu Dhabi Ground) position must be online before two AIR (Abu Dhabi Tower) positions may be opened.
