# 4. Air Control (“Abu Dhabi Tower”)
## 4.1 General provisions

Air Control (AIR) is responsible for all aerodrome movements on runways and their associated taxiways. AIR shall also ensure separation between IFR and VFR aircraft that are arriving at and
departing the aerodrome, as well as VFR aircraft operating within the aerodrome control zone.

## 4.2 Runway configuration
### 4.2.1 Simultaneous operation of instrument runways (SOIR)
The Abu Dhabi International Airport runways are 2,000 metres apart and comply with ICAO requirements for Simultaneous Operations of Instrument Runways (SOIR).
Segregated Runway Operations, i.e. one runway exclusively for arrivals and one exclusively for departures, are normally in use during busy arrival and departure times.

- Dependent Parallel Instrument Approaches shall be used as per ICAO Doc 9643 SOIR Mode 2 during peak arrival times and at other times as required by ATC with minimum 3 NM separation.
- During periods of reduced traffic demand, single runway, mixed-mode operations are used.
- During inbound peak-hours aircraft can expect to be vectored to either of the parallel runways to optimize the arrival sequence.
- ATIS will transmit “PARALLEL APPROACHES IN PROGRESS. PRIMARY ARRIVAL RUNWAY IS [IDENTIFIER FOR MAIN LANDING RUNWAY].” during peak arrival times when both runways are being used for arrivals.
- Pilots should exercise caution when selecting the ILS frequency.
- Pilots requiring the use of runway 13L / 31R for aircraft performance reasons outside of the times when Parallel Runway Operations are in use should advise ATC at the earliest opportunity. 
- Efforts will be made to make runway 13L / 31R available; however, delay may be experienced as returning this runway to service may take in excess of 15 minutes.
- Runway 13L / 31R should not be assumed to be available as a diversion alternate to runway 13R / 31L.

During SOIR pilots should take special care to comply with all ATC instructions due to:

- Aircraft landing runway 13L / 31R will be required to cross runway 13R / 31L to access parking stands.
- Military aircraft operating from OMAA north of runway 13L / 31R will be required to cross runway 13L / 31R to facilitate access to and from the military apron.
- Military aircraft can be expected to depart from runway 13L / 31R and arrival aircraft shouldbe aware that there may be departing traffic with possible increased arrival spacing to facilitate.


During SOIR, in the event of a blockage/unserviceability on the arrival runway, ATC will initiate single runway, mixed-mode operations and reposition aircraft to the available runway accordingly.

Training flights will not be facilitated at Abu Dhabi International Airport during parallel runway Operations.


## 4.3 Departure procedures
### 4.3.1 Standard departure points

| Runway | Standard departure points |
|:------:|:-------------------------:|
|        |                           |
|        |                           |
|        |                           |

### 4.3.2 Line up clearances

Conditional line up instructions must also include the traffic that the aircraft is to follow, as well as the word “behind” at the beginning and end of the transmission. 
It is suggested to only have a maximum of two conditional line up clearances active at one i.e. one aircraft lining up behind a departure, and another aircraft lining up behind them.
!!! example
    **Controller**: “SWR243, Behind the departing Emirates A380, via E15 line up runwaay 31L behind.
	
If aircraft have not yet reached the holding point where they are expected to line up at, ATC shall reiterate the cleared holding point.
!!! example
    **Controller**: “ETD11K, via e15, line up runway 31L”
	
### 4.3.3 Take-off clearances

Aircraft shall be cleared for take-off once adequate separation exists as provided in 4.3.4 and 4.5.
!!! example
    **Controller**: "ETD11K, Wind 330 degrees 7 knots, runway 31R, cleared for take-off"

### 4.3.4 Separation requirements
#### 4.3.4.1 General

Aircraft shall be separated on departure in compliance with standard IFR departure separation minima, wake turbulence separation requirements or as provided in 4.5 where applicable.

Except as provided in 4.3.4.2, succeeding aircraft on the same SID shall be separated by a minimum of 2 minutes.

VFR aircraft may be instructed to maintain visual separation with preceding aircraft and given a take- off clearance if no wake turbulence separation minima exists.

#### 4.3.4.2 Muscat FIR flow control procedure

Special flow control procedures are required for traffic entering the Muscat FIR via certain entry points after departure from UAE airports.

During off-peak times, this separation minima may be disregarded, and standard separation minima of 2 minutes may be applied provided it is not done for more than two successive departures.

|    SID     |    FIR exit point   | Longitudinal separation |
|:----------:|:-------------------:|-------------------------|
|   KANIP    |        LABRI        |        3 minutes        |
|            |                     |                         |
