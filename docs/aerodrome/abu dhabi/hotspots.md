# 6. Aerodrome Incursion Hotspots
## 6.1 General guidance
Due to the complex layout of the aerodrome, several areas exist which are prone to taxiway/runway incursions. Controllers must exercise caution and remain vigilant when aircraft are operating in these areas. The diagram below displays critical areas in Abu Dhabi

## 6.2 Hotspot A
Intersection of taxiways B, K and L - increased risk of misrouting 

## 6.3 Hotspot B
Intersection of taxiways K, A, B, G, H - increased risk of misrouting

## 6.4 Hotspot C
Stand 605L/C/R - Complex infrastructure, increased risk of taxiing to incorrect stand

## 6.5 Hotspot D
M/M6 - Increased risk of misroute

## 6.6 Hotspot E
Stand 618L/C/R - plex infrastructure, increased risk of taxiing to incorrect stand

## 6.7 Hotspot F

## 6.8 Hotspot G
Intersection of C, D, G & H - Increased risk of aircraft routing southbound prematurely turning from G on to C instead of D and aircraft on C/D missing the turn on to H

## 6.9 Hotspot H
Intersection of taxiways D10/D11 with C/D - Increased risk of runway incursion

## 6.10 Hotspot I
Intersection of E and E15 increased risk of taxiway incursion

## 6.11 Hotspot J
Taxiways F3/F4/F5 - Increased risk of conflict between aircraft
