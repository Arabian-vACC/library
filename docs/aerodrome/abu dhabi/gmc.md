# 4. Ground Movement Procedures
## 4.1 General provisions
The Ground Movement Controller (GMC) is responsible for managing aircraft movements on all aerodrome movement areas except for runways and their associated taxiways. Departing aircraft aregiven pushback instructions and instructions to taxi to the runway holding point.

Arriving aircraft are assigned a stand and instructed to taxi as appropriate.

## 4.2 Departure pushback procedures
### 4.2.1 General pushback procedures

### 4.2.2 Pushback types
#### 4.2.2.1 Standard pushback
When aircraft have been handed off from GMP, they shall be fully ready for pushback, and have reached their TOBT. Assuming no obstructions, they should be instructed to push back immediately.

Aircraft requesting push that are not squawking their assigned transponder code shall be instructed to hold position and squawk the correct code. They must not be allowed to move until doing so. Pushback direction is based primarily on aircraft location and runway configuration.

A pushback clearance must include the stand at which aircraft is located and an instruction to “FACE NORTH”, “FACE EAST”, “FACE SOUTH” and “FACE WEST” as appropriate to runway configuration and stand number.

In accordance with the pushback restrictions laid down in 4.2, aircraft shall generally be pushed back facing the departure runway threshold unless otherwise specified.

!!! example
    **ATC**: “RJA613, ABU DHABI GROUND, STAND 112, PUSH AND START APPROVED, FACE WEST ON FOXTROT”

Conditional pushback instructions may also be issued if an aircraft is taxiing behind another waiting for pushback.

!!! example
    **ATC**:“ETD562, BEHIND THE COMPANY A330 PASSING LEFT TO RIGHT, STAND 306, PUSH AND START APPROVED, FACE EAST BEHIND”


#### 4.2.2.2 Apron 1 pushback procedures
A maximum of 4 multiple pushback operations are permitted on Apron 1.
Aircraft parked on stands 101 and 102 may expect to:

- Pushback to face north.
- Pushback onto the taxiway on Apron 3 abeam stand 309 west of taxiway E9 intersectionfacing east.
- Pushback on taxiway F abeam stand 309 west of taxiway E9 intersection facing east.
- Pushback on taxiway F abeam stand 112 east of taxiway E9 facing west.


In the event of two aircraft requesting pushback at the same time, pushback approval for the second aircraft shall only be granted after the first aircraft has pushed back clear of taxiway E9.
Aircraft parked on stand 103 shall expect to push back facing south only Aircraft parked on stands 111 to 113 may expect to push back onto taxiway F between taxiway E9 and taxiway E11 and clear of the intersections. 
Aircraft shall be instructed to “FACE EAST” or “FACE WEST”.


!!!info
    Pushing an aircraft from stand 111 on taxiway F facing west will block taxiway E11; pushing an aircraft from stand 113 on taxiway F facing east will block taxiway E9.


Aircraft parked on stands 121 to 122 and 131 to 132 may expect to:

- Pushback to start-up on a position on the taxiway abeam stand 133 facing north; or
- Pushback to start-up on a position on taxiway F abeam stand 112 west of taxiway E11 intersection facing east. It should be noted that this manoeuvre will block pushback from stands 111 to 113.


In the event of two aircraft requesting pushback at the same time, the pushback approval for the second aircraft will be granted after the first aircraft is pushed onto taxiway F west of taxiway E11

Aircraft parked on stands 123 and 133 to 136 may expect to pushback to start-up on a position on the taxiway abeam stand 133 facing north.

Any preceding aircraft pushing from stands 121 to 122 or 131 to 132 must be pushed onto taxiway F west of taxiway E11 prior to pushback approval for aircraft from stands 123 or 133 to 136

#### 4.2.2.3 Apron 2 pushback procedures

- Aircraft pushing back from stand 222 shall be instructed to “FACE EAST”

Multiple pushbacks of aircraft facing the same direction or “nose to nose” shall be permitted provided that the aircraft are separated by 2 or more other parking stands.

Multiple pushbacks of aircraft facing “tail to tail” shall be permitted provided that the aircraft are separated by 3 or more other parking stands.

#### 4.2.2.4 Apron 3 pushback procedures
Aircraft shall pushback on the Apron 3 taxiway centreline facing east or west with the following restrictions:

!!!info 
    In the ‘nose to nose’ scenario ATC shall ensure that one taxiway is available between the two aircraft.

!!!info 
    Aircraft taxiing out via taxiway E9 (including Code F aircraft) are deemed to be separated from aircraft that have completed a pushback on taxiway E9 from stands 101, 102 or 103.

#### 4.2.2.5 Apron 4 pushback procedures

Aircraft on stands 123, 134, 135, 136 and 103 which request to start engine(s) on parking stand shall be unable to execute the standard pushback onto taxiway E9 or taxiway E11 facing north due to issues created by the jet blast towards the adjacent service road.


##### 4.2.2.7.2 Apron 4
When Pushing back from stand 410 facing west, ATC shall instruct the pilots to be pulled abeam stand 412 prior to start-up in order to avoid risk of jet blast incidents for the vehicles using the service road east of stand 410.

Aircraft taxi instructions to join the appropriate taxiway shall take into consideration the pushback procedures laid down in 4.2.

Caution must be exercised where departure taxi routings intersect or are expected to cross arrival taxi routes and rapid exit taxiways.

Where aircraft are taxied to runway holding points, transfer of control to AIR should be made early enough such that the aircraft is not required to stop its taxi.

To deconflict traffic, and to reduce the length of taxi clearances, intermediate holding points shall be used wherever possible.

!!! example
    **ATC**: “ETD89G, TAXI VIA ECHO 8, ECHO, HOLDING POINT ECHO 15”

### 4.3.2 Dual runway 31L/R departure taxi procedures
When departing from 31R, aircraft pushing back on apron 1 shall be instructed to taxi via E9 or E11 to join E and taxi to holding point E15.
Aircraft on apron 2 shall be instructed to taxi via E13 or E14 to join E and taxi to holding point E15.

Aircraft on apron 3 shall be instructed to taxi via E6 or E9 as appropriate to join E and taxi to holding point E15. Caution must be exercised at E8 and E6 taxiway intersection as this may be in use by arriving traffic.

Aircraft on aprons 4 and 5 shall join E via the closest available taxiway.

Eastbound traffic flow on E between E8 and E12 must be used with caution as these intersect with the rapid exit taxiways to be used by arriving aircraft on 31L.

Aircraft departing from 31R shall be instructed to cross 31L at E6, taxi via H, B then towards one of the available holding points for 31R.

(See 5.1)

(See 5.3)


## 4.4 Arrival taxi procedures
### 4.4.1 General arrival taxi procedures
Arriving aircraft shall not immediately be handed off by AIR. They must instead be given an initial taxi instruction to keep traffic flowing and ensure the rapid exit taxiways are kept clear. Therefore, GMC shall assign an arrival stand to aircraft when they are on final approach.
