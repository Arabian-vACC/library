# 4. Ground Movement Procedures
## 4.1 General provisions
The Ground Movement Controller (GMC) is responsible for managing aircraft movements on all aerodrome movement areas except for runways and their associated taxiways. Departing aircraft aregiven pushback instructions and instructions to taxi to the runway holding point.

Arriving aircraft are assigned a stand and instructed to taxi as appropriate.

## 4.2 Departure pushback procedures
### 4.2.1 General pushback procedures
When aircraft have been handed off from GMP, they shall be fully ready for pushback, and have reached their TOBT. Assuming no obstructions, they should be instructed to push back immediately.

!!! warning
    Traffic will be handed over from GMP with a **monitor** instruction and the **FREQ** tag will be applied in Euroscope. Once the **FREQ** status is showing, pilots have been transferred to GMC and can be called up by the GMC controller to push.

Aircraft ready for push that are not squawking their assigned transponder code shall be instructed to hold position and squawk the correct code. They must not be allowed to move until doing so. Pushback direction is based primarily on aircraft location and runway configuration.

In accordance with the pushback restrictions laid down in 4.2, aircraft shall generally be pushed back facing the departure runway threshold unless otherwise specified.

### 4.2.2 Pushback types
#### 4.2.2.1 Standard Pushback Clearance
A pushback clearance must include the stand at which aircraft is located and an instruction to “FACE NORTH”, “FACE EAST”, “FACE SOUTH” and “FACE WEST” as appropriate to runway configuration and stand number.

!!! example
    **ATC**: “RJA613, ABU DHABI GROUND, STAND 112, PUSH AND START APPROVED, FACE WEST ON FOXTROT”

#### 4.2.2.2 Conditional Pushback Clearance
Conditional pushback instructions may also be issued if an aircraft is taxiing behind another waiting for pushback.

!!! example
    **ATC**:“ETD562, BEHIND THE COMPANY A330 PASSING LEFT TO RIGHT, STAND 306, PUSH AND START APPROVED, FACE EAST, BEHIND”

### 4.2.3 Pushback Procedures

Aircraft on stands 123, 134, 135, 136 and 103 which request to start engine(s) on parking stand shall be unable to execute the standard pushback onto taxiway E9 or taxiway E11 facing north due to issues created by the jet blast towards the adjacent service road.

## 4.3 Departure taxi procedures
### 4.3.1 General departure taxi procedures
Aircraft taxi instructions to join the appropriate taxiway shall take into consideration the pushback procedures laid down in 4.2.

Caution must be exercised where departure taxi routings intersect or are expected to cross arrival taxi routes and rapid exit taxiways.

Where aircraft are taxied to runway holding points, transfer of control to AIR should be made early enough such that the aircraft is not required to stop its taxi.

To deconflict traffic, and to reduce the length of taxi clearances, intermediate holding points shall be used wherever possible.

!!! example
    **ATC**: “ETD89G, TAXI VIA ECHO 8, ECHO, HOLDING POINT ECHO 15”


### 4.3.2 Dual runway 31L/R departure taxi procedures
When departing from 31L, aircraft pushing back on apron 1 shall be instructed to taxi via E9 or E11 to join E and taxi to holding point E15.
Aircraft on apron 2 shall be instructed to taxi via E13 or E14 to join E and taxi to holding point E15.

Aircraft on apron 3 shall be instructed to taxi via E6 or E9 as appropriate to join E and taxi to holding point E15. Caution must be exercised at E8 and E6 taxiway intersection as this may be in use by arriving traffic.

Aircraft on aprons 4 and 5 shall join E via the closest available taxiway.

Aircraft on apron 6 shall taxi to join C, G, or H depending upon departure runway. Departing traffic should remain clear of B between A5 and G in order to ensure consistent flow of arrival traffic. Traffic from stands 643-692 should taxi south on K to join H then B for 31R, or K to join G for 31L.

Eastbound traffic flow on E between E8 and E12 must be used with caution as these intersect with the rapid exit taxiways to be used by arriving aircraft on 31L.

Aircraft departing from 31R from the south side of the airfield shall be instructed to cross 31L at E6, taxi via H, B then towards one of the available holding points for 31R.

(See 7.2.1)

Aircraft on apron 2 shall be instructed to taxi via E13 or E14 to join E and taxi to holding point E2 or E3. Caution must be exercised at taxiway E13 and E10 intersection as this may be in use by arriving aircraft on 13R.

Aircraft on apron 3 shall be instructed to taxi via E6 or E9 as appropriate to join E and taxi to holding point E2 or E3.

Aircraft on aprons 4 and 5 shall join E via the closest available taxiway.

Aircraft on apron 6 shall join to follow the D, H, B sequence to 13L as appropriate, following the routings laid out in section 7.2.2.

Westbound traffic flow on E between E10 and E7 must be used with caution as these intersect with the rapid exit taxiways to be used by arriving aircraft on 13R.

(See 7.2.2)

## 4.4 Arrival taxi procedures
### 4.4.1 General arrival taxi procedures
Arriving aircraft shall not immediately be handed off by AIR. They must instead be given an initial taxi instruction to keep traffic flowing and ensure the rapid exit taxiways are kept clear. Therefore, GMC shall assign an arrival stand to aircraft when they are on final approach.

Once the aircraft is handed off to GMC, they may be taxied to their stand.

### 4.4.2 Runway 31L/R arrival taxi procedures
Aircraft landing on 31L shall vacate onto E8 and shall be given an initial taxi towards E6, or right on E depending on the stand assignment described in 4.4.4. After initial taxi is issued by AIR, aircraft are handed off to GMC.

Aircraft shall vacate 31R onto an appropriate exit taxiway and shall then be instructed to join B before being handed off to GMC. Aircraft shall taxi via H when the operations mode is arrival only for 31R, otherwise they shall be instructed to taxi via G. Aircraft shall cross 31L at H.

Aircraft parking on aprons 1, 2, 3 and 5 shall be instructed to taxi via F to an appropriate link taxiway.

Aircraft parking on apron 4 shall be instructed to taxi via E.

Aircraft parking on apron 6 shall join via K3, K6, L3, M3 or M4 and taxi as appropriate to the stand

(See 7.2.1)

### 4.4.3 Runway 13L/R arrival taxi procedures
Aircraft shall vacate 13R onto E10 and shall be given an initial taxi towards E13. After initial taxi is issued by AIR, aircraft are handed off to GMC.

Aircraft shall vacate 13L onto an appropriate exit taxiway and shall then be instructed to join B before being handed off to GMC. Aircraft shall taxi via H when the operations mode is arrival only for 13L, otherwise they shall be instructed to taxi via G. Aircraft shall cross 13R at H.

Aircraft parking on te south side of the airport shall be instructed to taxi via F to an appropriate link taxiway.

(See 7.2.2)

### 4.4.4 Stand allocation procedure
