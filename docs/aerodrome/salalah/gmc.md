# 4. Ground Movement Procedures
## 4.1 General Provisions
GMC is also responsible for managing aircraft movements on all aerodrome movement areas except for runways and their associated taxiways. Departing aircraft are given pushback instructions and instructions to taxi to the runway holding point. Arriving aircraft are assigned a stand and instructed to taxi as appropriate. 

## 4.2 Departure Pushback Procedures
### 4.2.1 General Pushback Procedures
Assuming no obstructions, aircraft shall be instructed to pushback immediately.

Aircraft requesting pushback that are not squawking their assigned transponder code shall be instructed to hold position and squawk the correct code; movement of such aircraft is prohibited.

Pushback direction is based primarily on aircraft location.

Aircraft parked at the Cargo Apron and Nothern Apron shall be instructed to push back *facing east* when Runway 25 is in use, and *facing west* when Runway 07 is in use.

Aircraft parked at the southern apron are positioned on straight-out stands and therefore do not require pushback clearance. These aircraft shall request engine start-up clearance first, followed by taxi clearance when ready.

!!! example
      **Controller:** ADY268, Salalah Ground, pushback approved, facing east.

      **Pilot:** Pushback approved, facing east, ADY268.

!!! note
      Conditional pushback instructions may also be issued if an aircraft is taxiing behind another waiting for pushback.

!!! example
      **Controler:** ADY268, Salalah ground, behind the Qatari A320 passing left to right, pushback approved, facing east, behind.

      **Pilot:** Behind the Qatari A320 passing left to right, pushback approved, facing east, behind, ADY268.

### 4.2.2 Pushback Types
#### 4.2.2.1 Standard Pushback
This type will normally have the aircraft stop abeam the adjacent stand. The phraseology for this type of pushback is identical to the pushback phraseology as provided in 2.8.1.

#### 4.2.2.2 Short Pushback
A short pushback instruction shall require the aircraft to complete the pushback abeam the current stand such that the adjacent stand will not be blocked.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Salalah Ground, OMS106, on stand 15 request pushback."

    **Controller**: "OMS106, Salalah Ground, short pushback approved, face east to finish abeam stand 13R."

    **Pilot**: "Short pushback approved, facing east to finish abeam stand 13R, OMS106."

#### 4.2.2.3 Long Pushback
A long pushback instruction shall require aircraft to complete the pushback operation two stands away from where the pushback was commenced. This manoeuvre may be used when aircraft are vacating a stand to be used by another aircraft that is taxiing in.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Salalah Ground, OMS106, on stand 13R request pushback."

    **Controller**: "OMS106, Salalah Ground, long pushback approved, face east to finish abeam stand 10."

    **Pilot**: "Long pushback approved, facing east to finish abeam stand 10, OMS106."

## 4.3 Departure Taxi Procedures
### 4.3.1 General Departure Taxi Procedures
Where aircraft are taxied to runway holding points, transfer of control to AIR should be made early enough such that the aircraft is not required to stop its taxi. 

To deconflict traffic and to reduce the length of taxi clearances, intermediate holding points shall be used wherever possible.

!!! example
      **Controller:** ADY268, taxi via A2 and C, holding point D8, Runway 25.

      **Pilot:** Taxi via A2 and C, holding point D8, Runway 25, ADY268.

### 4.3.2 Runway 07 Departure Taxi Procedures
When departing from Runway 07, aircraft taxiing from the Cargo and Nothern Aprons shall be instructed to taxi westbound to exit their aprons and then taxi via C to holding point D1.

Aircraft on the southern apron shall be instructed to taxi westbound on G to holding point E2.

!!! warning
    Aircraft on the Cargo Apron and Nothern Apron shall exit westbound via taxiways B3 or B5 to allow arriving aircraft to access the apron via B4 or B6.

### 4.3.3 Runway 25 Departure Taxi Procedures
When departing from Runway 25, aircraft taxiing from the Cargo and Nothern Aprons shall be instructed to taxi eastbound to exit their aprons and then taxi via C to holding point D8.

Aircraft on the southern apron shall be instructed to taxi via H8 to holding point E8.

!!! warning
    Aircraft on the Cargo Apron and Nothern Apron shall exit eastbound via taxiways B4 or B6 to allow arriving aircraft to access the apron via B3 or B5.

## 4.4 Arrival Taxi Procedures
### 4.4.1 General Arrival Taxi Procedures
GMC shall assign an arrival stand to aircraft when they are on final approach.

Once the aircraft is handed off to GMC, they shall be taxied to their stand in accordance with the procedures laid down in 2.10.4. 

### 4.4.2 Runway 07 Arrival Taxi Procedures
Aircraft shall vacate Runway 07 onto D6 and are then handed off to GMC.

Aircraft shall be taxied via Taxiway C to the assigned stand. Aircraft destined for the Southern Apron shall be taxied to holding point D8 for runway crossing.

### 4.4.3 Runway 25 Arrival Taxi Procedures
Aircraft shall vacate Runway 25 onto D3 and are then handed off to GMC.

Aircraft shall be taxied via Taxiway C to the assigned stand. Aircraft destined for the Southern Apron shall be taxied to holding point D2 for runway crossing.

### 4.4.4 Stand Allocation Procedure
|                 Area                |        Operator        |
|:-----------------------------------:|:----------------------:|
| Northern Apron (Passenger Terminal) | Commercial Air Traffic |
|             Cargo Apron             |    Cargo Air Traffic   |
|            Southern Apron           |           Any          |

### 4.4.5 Stand Restrictions
All stands without an 'L' or 'R' designation are capable of accommodating aircraft up to Code E. Stands with an 'L' or 'R' designation are limited to Code C operations. All stands on the Southern Apron are capable of accommodating aircraft up to Code E.

## 4.5 Designated Areas of Responsibility
### 4.5.1 GMC Positions
GMC is responsible for all aprons and associated taxiways.

### 4.5.2 Handoff Procedure
Where transfer of control is to be made between controllers, aircraft shall not be cleared to a point beyond the current controllerâ€™s designated zone of responsibility unless there has been prior coordination with the next controller. Intermediate holding points may be used to satisfy this requirement.
