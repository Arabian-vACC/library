# 3. Air Control ("Salalah Tower")
## 3.1 General provisions
Air Control (AIR) is responsible for all aerodrome movements on runways and their associated taxiways. AIR shall also ensure separation between IFR aircraft that are arriving at and departing the aerodrome, as well as provide traffic information to VFR aircraft operating within the aerodrome control zone.

## 3.2 Preferential runways
The preferred calm wind configuration is using runway 25, which may be utilized with a tailwind of up to 5 knots. If this configuration is not feasible due to wind conditions or other factors, runway 07 shall be used instead.

## 3.3 Departure procedures
### 3.3.1 Line up clearances
Conditional line up instructions shall include the traffic that the aircraft is to follow, as well as the word “behind” at the beginning and end of the transmission. It is recommended to only have a maximum of two conditional line up clearances active at one i.e., one aircraft lining up behind a departure, and another aircraft lining up behind them.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "ADY268, behind the departing Qatari Airbus A320, via D8, line up and wait runway 25 behind."

If aircraft have not yet reached the holding point where they are expected to line up at, ATC shall reiterate the cleared holding point.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "ADY268, via D8, line up and wait runway 25."

### 3.3.2 Take-off clearances
Aircraft shall be cleared for take-off once adequate separation exists as provided in 3.3.3.1. 

!!! example
    **Controller**: "ADY268, wind 240 degrees 7 knots, runway 25, cleared for take-off."

### 3.3.3 Separation requirements
#### 3.3.3.1 General
Aircraft shall be separated on departure in compliance with standard IFR departure separation minima requirements.

Succeeding aircraft on the same SID shall be separated by a minimum of 2 minutes.

VFR aircraft may be instructed to maintain visual separation with preceding aircraft and given a take- off clearance if no wake turbulence separation minima exists.

### 3.3.4 IFR handoff procedure
#### 3.3.4.1 General
IFR departures shall be handed off to Salalah Radar.

Where no Radar controller is present, aircraft shall be handed off directly to the appropriate Muscat Control controller.

Aircraft shall be handed off when passing 1,000 ft to ensure adequate time for a frequency change and avoid a level-off on departure.

### 3.3.5 Stopping a departure
Aircraft that have commenced their take-off roll may be instructed to stop immediately to avert a collision due to a runway incursion or any other dangerous situation. 

It must be noted though, that the instruction to stop must be given early enough such that the aircraft does not reach its decision speed. Therefore, aerodrome controllers must be vigilant and remain aware of the location of traffic at all times.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "ADY268, stop immediately, I say again stop immediately, truck entering the runway!"

For aircraft that have been given a take-off clearance, but have not yet started the roll, they shall be instructed to hold position and the take-off clearance must be cancelled along with the reason for cancellation.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "ADY268, hold position, cancel take-off, I say again cancel take-off, aircraft entering the runway, acknowledge."

## 3.4 Arrival procedures
### 3.4.1 Separation requirements
#### 3.4.1.1 General
While the radar controllers are responsible for separating arriving aircraft, the AIR controller shall still ensure that minimum separation is maintained until the preceding aircraft crosses the runway threshold. 

#### 3.4.1.2 Speed control
If it is apparent that minimum separation may not exist as provided in 3.4.1.1, AIR may use a tactical reduction in aircraft speed.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "ADY268, reduce to final approach speed."

#### 3.4.1.3 Visual separation
Aircraft may be instructed to maintain own separation visually, if speed control alone will not resolve the conflict. This shall only be done in VMC and with agreement with the pilot. If no other solutions are practical, the succeeding aircraft shall be instructed to go around.

### 3.4.2 Go-around instruction
#### 3.4.2.1 General go-around procedure
At any time should a runway become unsuitable for an aircraft landing, or separation minima is not met, aircraft shall be instructed to go-around.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "ADY268, go around, I say again, go around, acknowledge."

Once aircraft have acknowledged the instruction and are observed to be safely climbing away, they shall be handed off to departure control.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "TCM1TM, climb to 6,000 ft via standard missed approach, contact Salalah Radar 119.100."

### 3.4.3 Arrival taxi procedures
Aircraft shall be provided an initial taxi clearance to ensure they are kept moving such that the exit taxiway is clear for the next arrival.

The initial taxi shall include instructions to taxi “LEFT” or “RIGHT” onto the relevant taxiway as appropriate and hold short on a suitable taxiway.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "ABY390, taxi right on C, hold short C3."

Once aircraft have been observed to be taxiing and completely clear of the exit, transfer of control shall be initiated to GMC provided there will be no conflicts with other arriving traffic.

## 3.5 VFR procedures
### 3.5.1 VFR departures
Once VFR aircraft are ready for departure, they should be cleared for take-off in sequence. As they begin their crosswind turn (the first turn after departure) they shall be instructed to report leaving the control zone.

Once aircraft are clear of the zone, they shall be instructed to contact Salalah Radar.

### 3.5.2 VFR traffic remaining in the circuit
AIR control is responsible for managing circuit traffic. Circuits must always be conducted to the north of the aerodrome

Circuits shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures laid down in 2.7.2.

Once aircraft are ready for departure, they should be cleared for take-off in sequence. As they begin their crosswind turn (the first turn after departure) they shall be instructed to report when they are on the downwind with their intentions. 

!!! example
      **Controller:** A4O-OAD, report downwind with intentions.

Aircraft may request either a touch and go (where the aircraft lands and immediately takes off), a stop and go (where the aircraft lands, comes to a complete stop on the runway, then takes off), a low approach (where the aircraft flies low over the runway without landing), or a full stop (where the aircraft lands and vacates the runway).

Once AIR is aware of the aircraft’s request, they may be sequenced to the runway, with due consideration given to runway occupancy time. 

Aircraft on the downwind should be passed the following information: 
- Expected runway;
- Sequence; 
- Traffic information if applicable

!!! example
      **Controller:** A4O-OAD, report final runway 25, number 1, traffic is an A320 upwind runway 25.

### 3.5.3 VFR arrivals
Inbound VFR aircraft shall be instructed to contact AIR with enough time such that two-way radio communications has been established before aircraft enter the aerodrome control zone. On first contact, AIR will pass circuit joining instructions, as well as any other pertinent information. 

!!! example
      **Controller:** A4O-OAD, Salalah Tower, join right hand downwind runway 07, 1,100 ft VFR, QNH 1015.
