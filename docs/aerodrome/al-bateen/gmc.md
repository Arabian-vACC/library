# 3. Ground Movement Procedures
## 3.1 General provisions
The Ground Movement Controller (GMC) is responsible for managing aircraft movements on all aerodrome movement areas except for runways and their associated taxiways. Departing aircraft aregiven pushback instructions and instructions to taxi to the runway holding point.

Arriving aircraft are assigned a stand and instructed to taxi as appropriate.

## 3.2 Departure Start-up procedures
### 3.2.1 General Start-up procedures
Assuming Al Bateen is designed for a Class C Aerodrome, no pushback procedures are conducted at Delma, rather Start-up and Taxi procedures take place.

!!! Example
    **Pilot:** Al Bateen Ground, A6-LLG, Apron C, request start-up.
    
    **Controller:** A6-LLG, Al Bateen Ground, Start-up approved, report ready for taxi,

Aircraft requesting Taxi that are not squawking their assigned transponder code shall be instructed to hold position and squawk the correct code; movement of such aircraft is prohibited.
## 3.3 Departure taxi procedures
### 3.3.1 General departure taxi procedures
Aircraft taxi instructions to join the appropriate taxiway shall take into consideration the pushback procedures laid down in 3.2.

Caution must be exercised where departure taxi routings intersect or are expected to cross arrival taxi routes and rapid exit taxiways.

Where aircraft are taxied to runway holding points, transfer of control to AIR should be made early enough such that the aircraft is not required to stop its taxi.

To deconflict traffic, and to reduce the length of taxi clearances, intermediate holding points shall be used wherever possible.

!!! Example
    **Controller:** IFA6487, Taxi T, hold TP8

## 3.4 Arrival taxi procedures
### 3.4.1  General arrival taxi procedures
Arriving aircraft shall not immediately be handed off by AIR. They must instead be given an initial taxi instruction to keep traffic flowing and ensure the rapid exit taxiways are kept clear. Therefore, GMC shall assign an arrival apron to aircraft when they are on final approach.

Once the aircraft is handed off to GMC, they may be taxied to their Apron.
