# 4. Air Control Procedures
## 4.1 General provisions
Air Control (AIR) is responsible for all aerodrome movements on runways and their associated taxiways. AIR shall also ensure separation between IFR aircraft that are arriving at and departing the aerodrome, as well as provide traffic information between IFR and VFR aircraft operating within the aerodrome control zone. as well as traffic information between VFR aircraft operating within the aerodrome control zone.

## 4.2 Preferential runways
Due to the close interaction between arrival and departure procedures within the Abu Dhabi CTA, the active runway at Al Bateen shall be determined by the active runway direction at Abu Dhabi Zayed International airport.


## 4.3 Departure procedures
### 4.3.1 Line up clearances
Conditional line up instructions must also include the traffic that the aircraft is to follow, as well as the word “behind” at the beginning and end of the transmission. It is suggested to only have a maximum of two conditional line up clearances active at one i.e. one aircraft lining up behind a departure, and another aircraft lining up behind them.
!!! Example
    **Controller:** IFA6487, Behind departing Cessna 172, via T6, line-up & wait, runway 31, behind.

If aircraft have not yet reached the holding point where they are expected to line up at, ATC shall reiterate the cleared holding point.

!!! Example
    IFA64K, via T1, line-up & wait, runway 13.


### 4.3.2 Take-off clearances
Aircraft shall be cleared for take-off once adequate separation exists as provided in 4.3.3.

!!! Example
    IFA6922, Wind 330 degrees 7 knots, runway 31, cleared for take-off.

### 4.3.3 Separation requirements
#### 4.3.3.1
Aircraft shall be separated on departure in compliance with standard IFR departure separation minima, and wake turbulence separation requirements as provided.

Except as provided in 4.3.3.2, succeeding aircraft on the same SID shall be separated by a minimum of 2 minutes.

VFR aircraft may be instructed to maintain visual separation with preceding aircraft and given a take-off clearance if no wake turbulence separation minima exists.

#### 4.3.3.2 Muscat FIR flow control procedure
Special flow control procedures are required for traffic entering the Muscat FIR via certain entry points after departure from UAE airports.

During off-peak times, this separation minima may be disregarded, and standard separation minima of 2 minutes may be applied provided it is not done for more than two successive departures.

|  SID  | FIR exit point | Longitudinal separation |
|:-----:|:--------------:|-------------------------|
| KANIP |      LARBI     | 3 minutes               |

### 4.3.4 Stopping a departure
Aircraft that have commenced their take-off roll may be instructed to stop immediately to avert a collision due to a runway incursion or any other dangerous situation.

!!! Warning
    The instruction to stop must be given early enough such that the aircraft does not reach its decision speed. Therefore, aerodrome controllers must be vigilant and remain aware of the location of traffic and all times as well as runway incursion hotspots.

!!! Example
    **Controller:** IFA6922, Stop immediately, I say again stop immediately, vehicle entering the runway!

For aircraft that have been given a take-off clearance, but have not yet started the roll, they should be instructed to hold position and the take-off clearance must be cancelled along with the reason for cancellation.

!!! Example
    **Controller:** IFA772, hold position, cancel takeoff clearance, I say again cancel takeoff clearance, aircraft entering the runway, acknowledge.

## 4.4 Arrival procedures
### 4.4.1 General
Although the radar controllers are responsible for separating arriving aircraft, the AIR controller shall still ensure that minimum separation is maintained until the preceding aircraft crosses the runway threshold.

### 4.4.2 Speed control
If it is apparent that minimum separation may not exist as provided in Dubai Enhanced Wake Turbulence Separation (eWTS) or minimum radar separation minima, AIR may use a tactical reduction in aircraft speed.

!!! Example
    **Controller:** IFA772, reduce to final approach speed.

### 4.4.3 Visual separation
Aircraft may be instructed to maintain own separation visually, if speed control alone will not resolve the conflict. This shall only be done in VMC and with agreement with the pilot. If no other solutions are practical, the succeeding aircraft shall be instructed to go around.

### 4.4.4 Go around instruction
At any time should a runway become unsuitable for an aircraft landing, or separation minima is not met, aircraft shall be instructed to go-around.

!!! Example
    **Controller:** IFA8347, Go around, I say again, go around, acknowledge.

Once aircraft are observed to be safely climbing away, they shall be handed off to departure control.

!!! Example
    **Controller:** IFA8347 Climb to 3000ft via standard missed approach, contact Abu Dhabi Radar on 124.400

### 4.4.5 Arrival taxi procedures
Aircraft shall be provided an initial taxi clearance to ensure they are kept moving such that the exit taxiway (RET) is clear for the next arrival and to minimise runway occupancy times.

The initial taxi shall include instructions to taxi “LEFT” or “RIGHT” onto the relevant taxiway as appropriate and hold at a suitable intermediate holding point.

!!! Example
    **Controller:** IFA8347, Taxi left on T, hold TP9

Once aircraft have been observed to be taxiing and completely clear of the exit, transfer of control shall be initiated to GMC provided there will be no conflicts with other arriving traffic.

## 4.5 VFR procedures
### 4.5.1 VFR departures
Once VFR aircraft are ready for departure, they should be cleared for take-off in sequence. As they begin their crosswind turn (the first turn after departure) they shall be instructed to report leaving the control zone.

VFR traffic shall obtain an ATC clearance before crossing the runway extended centre line.

Once aircraft are clear of the zone, they shall be instructed to remain outside controlled airspace and monitor advisory.

Aircraft climbing into controlled airspace shall be handed off to departure control.

### 4.5.2 VFR traffic remaining in the circuit
AIR control is responsible for managing circuit traffic.

**Left-Hand** Circuits shall be conducted on runway 13 not above an altitude 1500ft.
**Right-Hand** Circuits shall be conducted on runway 31 not above an altitude of 1500ft

Once aircraft are ready for departure, they should be cleared for take-off in sequence. As they begin their crosswind turn (the first turn after departure) they shall be instructed to report when they are on the downwind with their intentions.

!!! Example
    **Controller:** A6-PAB, report downwind with intenstions.

Aircraft may request either a touch and go (where the aircraft lands and immediately takes off), a stop and go (where the aircraft lands, comes to a complete stop on the runway, then takes off), a low approach (where the aircraft flies low over the runway without landing), or a full stop (where the aircraft lands and vacates the runway).

Once AIR is aware of the aircraft’s request, they may be sequenced to the runway, with due consideration given to runway occupancy time.

Aircraft on the downwind should be passed the following information: - Expected runway; - Sequence; - Traffic information if applicable

!!! Example
    **Controller:** A6-PAB, report final runway 31, number 1, traffic is a C172 on a 2 mile final runway 31.

### 4.5.3 VFR arrivals
Inbound VFR aircraft shall be instructed to contact AIR with enough time such that two-way radio communications has been established before aircraft enter the aerodrome control zone. On first contact, AIR will pass circuit joining instructions, as well as any other pertinent information.

!!! Example
    **Controller:** A6-PAB, joing right-hand downwind runway 31, not above 1500ft VFR, QNH1014.
