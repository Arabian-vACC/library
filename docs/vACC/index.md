Formerly known as the Emirates vACC, the Arabian vACC was established on October 29, 2021, through the merger of the Emirates vACC with Bahrain, Doha, and Muscat vACCs. This strategic integration allows us to cover the extensive airspaces of Bahrain, Doha, the U.A.E, and Oman, offering comprehensive Air Traffic Control services and top-tier training programs.

Our dedicated marketing team is committed to creating dynamic weekly and monthly events across our FIRs. These events range from exciting city-pair flights to adventurous short and long-haul journeys, ensuring a diverse and engaging experience for all participants. 

At the heart of our mission and vision is a steadfast commitment to excellence. We strive to provide the VATSIM Network and its members with the highest quality of air traffic control services. Our goal is to support pilots flying within our airspaces and foster a vibrant and active community in the Middle East & North Africa region.
