# Arriving Traffic
## STAR Assignment
STAR assignments are based on the waypoint at which you enter the Muscat Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA). ATC will assign the appropriate STAR depending on traffic conditions and active runway.

!!! warning
    All STARs into Muscat include altitude and speed restrictions, which must be adhered to unless explicitly canceled by ATC. Pilots should verify clearance levels through instructions such as "**DESCEND VIA STAR**," "**DESCEND UNRESTRICTED**," or "**CANCEL STAR SPEEDS**."

## Runway Assignment
The arrival runway is specified in the Muscat Arrival ATIS.

## Approach
The standard approach at Muscat is the ILS, however the expected approach can be found in the Muscat Arrival ATIS.

## Speeds
The speed limits and recommended speeds within different segments of the Muscat terminal area is as follows:

|  Speed Range  |              Arrival Segment              |
|:-------------:|:-----------------------------------------:|
|    250 kts    |              Below 10,000 ft              |
| 230 - 210 kts |           Initial approach phase          |
|    180 kts    | Base leg/closed heading to final approach |
|    180 kts    |                Until 10 DME               |
|    160 kts    |                Until 4 DME                |


All speed restrictions must be adhered to as accurately as possible. Aircraft unable to comply with these restrictions must notify ATC in advance and specify the speeds they can maintain. Pilots should also inform ATC if circumstances require a speed adjustment for any reason.  

To ensure accurate spacing, pilots are requested to comply with speed adjustments as promptly as practicable, considering their operational constraints.  

If traffic sequencing does not require speed limitations, ATC will advise, “**NO ATC SPEED RESTRICTION**.”  

## Landing
### Minimum Runway Occupancy
During peak traffic periods, rapid runway vacating is essential to prevent disruption to the aerodrome traffic flow. Ensure your entire aircraft has passed the designated runway holding point before considering yourself clear. Avoid unnecessary stops before exiting completely.

All rapid exit taxiways are equipped with rapid taxiway indicator lights. Pilots are encouraged to maintain the designated exit taxi speed of 50 knots.

|  Runway  |  Rapid Exit Taxiways  |
|----------|-----------------------|
| 08L/26R  |        Y4, Y5         |
| 08R/26L  |    E3, E4, E5, E6     |

This procedure supports efficient runway occupancy time and maximizes traffic throughput.

## Taxi
After landing, aircraft must not stop on the rapid exit taxiways and shall continue taxiing according to the following procedures unless otherwise instructed by the tower controller:  

- **Runway 08L:** Continue via W, Westbound
- **Runway 26R:** Continue via V, Eastbound  
- **Runway 08R:** Continue via G, Westbound 
- **Runway 26L:** Continue via G, Northbound
