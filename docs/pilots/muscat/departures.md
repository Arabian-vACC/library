# Departing Traffic
## Flight Planning: Route(s)
Pilots can find valid routes for most flights departing from Muscat on SimBrief by choosing the "Preferred Route" option. Our operations department updates the "Preferred Route" on SimBrief with every AIRAC cycle, ensuring compliance with Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) regulations in the Middle East and Eurocontrol IFPS validation.

## Flight Planning: Standard Instrument Departure (SID)
Controllers will assign a Standard Instrument Departure (SID), guiding you out of the Muscat Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA). Refer to the table below to see which SID you can expect. If your waypoint isn't listed in the table, ensure your AIRAC cycle is up to date. If your AIRAC is outdated, please inform the controller promptly so we can arrange an omnidirectional departure for you. All initial climbs are set at 3000ft

However, as of the current publication, these RNAV SIDs are temporary due to ongoing aerodrome and airspace restructuring.
In the interim, only four temporary SIDs are in use.

| Runway |   SID   |
|:------:|:-------:|
|  08L  | MURMA1N |
|  26R  | ITLAK1N |
|  08R  |  S08R D |
|  26L  |  S26L D |

These temporary SIDs require aircraft to maintain runway heading on departure climbing to 3,000 feet. Departing aircraft can expect to receive radar vectors from Muscat Approach to join their filed airways.

!!! Note
    You can determine your departure runway by checking the Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS).

## Getting your clearance
Departing aircraft shall contact Muscat Delivery **10 minutes prior to start-up** and pass the following information:
<ul>
    <li>Aircraft Callsign</li>
    <li>Aircraft Type</li>
    <li>Parking Stand</li>
    <li>Requested Flight Level</li>
    <li>Destination</li>
    <li>Current Departure ATIS Information</li>
</ul>

### Datalink Clearance (DCL)
Muscat Aerodrome does not support the issuance of departure clearances via datalink (ACARS). All clearances shall be obtained through voice communication.

### Voice Clearance
In Muscat, voice clearances will be provided at all times. These will be covering your Destination, all Airways and the Muscat FIR Exit Point, your Standard Instrument Departure (SID), initial climb, and squawk code. Ensure you have the latest departure ATIS information before proceeding.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Muscat Clearance Delivery, OMS735, Airbus A320 NEO, information R, stand 105, requesting FL310, to Hyderabad."

    **Controller**: "OMS735, Muscat Clearance Delivery, information R correct, cleared to Hyderabad via N881 to RASKI, ITLAK1N departure, maintain altitude 3,000 ft, squawk 4701."

    **Pilot**: "Cleared to Hyderabad via N881 to RASKI, ITLAK1N departure, maintain altitude 3,000 ft, squawk 4701, OMS735."

    **Controller**: "OMS735, readback correct, QNH 1016, report ready for pushback."

!!! warning
    Clearance delivery will not provide push and start clearance. However, remain on the clearance delivery frequency; do not switch to the ground frequency on your own. You must report fully ready on the delivery frequencyâ€”this includes having the jetway disconnected, tug connected, and chocks removed. Delivery will advise when to switch to the appropriate ground frequency, based on the current airport departure rate.

## Push & Start
Once clearance delivery releases you to the designated ground frequency, pilots may request push and start clearance. Upon initial contact, the ground controller may provide various types of pushback instructions. Pilots must ensure they can comply with these instructions; if unable, they must inform the ground controller.

Pushback clearances will specify a direction to face, such as West or East, and a particular taxiway to push onto.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "OMA601, pushback and start approved, face North on S."

!!! warning
    If pilots are unable to commence pushback within 2-3 minutes, the pushback clearance may be revoked, and slot times will be recalculated.

## Taxi
Pilots must comply with all taxi instructions, including holds. Taxi instructions are given based on various factors such as aircraft type and traffic.

!!! info
    Controllers regularly make use of intermediate holding points to optimise traffic flow. These can be found on the **Taxi and Parking** charts.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "OMA661, Muscat Ground, taxi via T, hold T1."

### Standard Intersection Departures
For the purposes of takeoff performance planning the standard departure taxiways are:

* 26R - Y7/Y8
* 08L - Y2/Y1
* 26L - E8/E9
* 08R - E2

Crews should base their performance calculations on departure from standard departure points from the notified runway in use if there is no restriction to payload.

ATC may tactically use a different departure point nearer the runway end based on the traffic situation.
