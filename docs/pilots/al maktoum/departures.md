# Departing Traffic
## Flight Planning: Route(s)
Pilots can find valid routes for most flights departing from Al Maktoum on SimBrief by choosing the "Preferred Route" option. Our operations department updates the "Preferred Route" on SimBrief with every AIRAC cycle, ensuring compliance with Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) regulations in the Middle East and Eurocontrol IFPS validation.

!!! info
    Al Maktoum shares common SID end points with Dubai in order to manage traffic flow within the Dubai TMA

## Flight Planning: Standard Instrument Departure (SID)
Controllers will assign a Standard Instrument Departure (SID) based on the first waypoint in your flight plan, guiding you out of the Dubai Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA). Refer to the table below to see which SID you can expect. If your waypoint isn't listed in the table, ensure your AIRAC cycle is up to date. If your AIRAC is outdated, please inform the controller promptly so we can arrange an omnidirectional departure for you.

Departures from runway 12/30 has an initial climb of 3000ft. and Departures from runway 13/31 has an initial climb of 2000ft.

## Getting your clearance
Departing aircraft shall contact Sharjah Ground **10 minutes prior to start-up** and pass the following information:
<ul>
    <li>Aircraft Callsign</li>
    <li>Aircraft Type</li>
    <li>Parking Stand</li>
    <li>Frequency handoff</li>
    <li>Destination</li>
    <li>Current ATIS Information and QNH</li>
</ul>

### Initial Clearance
Datalink clearances are currently unavailable at Sharjah. Clearance should be requested on the Sharjah Ground frequency. Clearances will include your Standard Instrument Departure (SID), initial climb, squawk code and airborne frequency. Ensure you have the latest ATIS information before proceeding.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Al Maktoum Ground, good evening, UAE9782, Boeing 777-200LR, stand S298, requesting IFR clearance to Hong Kong, exiting the Dubai control zone at ANVIX."

    **Controller**: "UAE9782, cleared to Hong Kong via the ANVIX4L departure, maintain altitude 3000ft, squawk 0542."

    **Pilot**: "Cleared to Hong Kong, ANVIX4L departure, maintain altitude 3000ft, squawk 0542, UAE9782."

    **Controller**: "UAE9782, readback correct, information Foxtrot, QNH 1009, report ready for pushback."

## Push & Start
Once the pushback tug is connected, and chocks removed, pilots may request push and start clearance. The ground controller will usually provide the direction to face. Pilots must ensure they can comply with these instructions; if unable, they must inform the ground controller.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "UAE9212, Al Maktoum Ground, pushback approved, facing north."

!!! warning
    If pilots are unable to commence pushback within 2-3 minutes, the pushback clearance may be revoked, and slot times will be recalculated.

## Taxi
Pilots must comply with all taxi instructions, including holds. Taxi instructions are given based on various factors such as aircraft type and traffic. Taxi should be expected via the next available linking taxiway to taxiway A, then direct to the appropriate holding point. This may differ based on operational requirements.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "UAE9876, Al Maktoum Ground, Taxi via Z7, Z, hold ZM."

### Standard Intersection Departures
For the purposes of takeoff performance planning the standard departure taxiways are:

* 12 - V4/V1
* 30 - V13
* 13 - A1/A2
* 31 - A6/A7

Crews should base their performance calculations on departure from standard departure points from the notified runway in use.

## Take-off
### Minimum Runway Occupancy
On receipt of a line-up clearance pilots shall ensure, complying with safety and standard operating procedures, that they are able to line-up on the runway as soon as the preceding aircraft has commenced take-off roll or landing run.

Wherever possible, pilots are encouraged to conduct a rolling takeoff to minimise runway occupancy time.
