# Arriving Traffic
## STAR Assignment
STAR assignments are based on the waypoint at which you enter the Abu Dhabi Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA). ATC will assign the appropriate STAR depending on traffic conditions and active runway.

!!! warning
    All STARs into Al Bateen include altitude and speed restrictions, which must be adhered to unless explicitly canceled by ATC. Pilots should verify clearance levels through instructions such as "DESCEND VIA STAR," "DESCEND UNRESTRICTED," or "CANCEL STAR SPEEDS."

## Runway Assignment
Due to close interaction between arrival and departures in Sheikh Zayed International Airport, the arrival runway is determined by the runways in use at Abu Dhabi, and the Abu Dhabi ATIS can be referred to for general information. Al Bateen Tower will provide updated weather information.

## Approach
The standard approach at Al Bateen is the ILS, however the expected approach will be provided by Abu Dhabi Radar.

All speed restrictions provided by ATC must be adhered to as accurately as possible. Pilots also inform ATC if circumstances require a speed adjustment for any reason.

To ensure accurate spacing, pilots are requested to comply with speed adjustments as promptly as practicable, considering their operational constraints.
