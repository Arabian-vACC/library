# Arriving Traffic
## Star Assignment
STAR assignments are based on the waypoint at which you enter the Fujairah Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA). ATC will assign the appropriate STAR depending on traffic conditions and active runway.

!!! warning
    All STARs into Dubai include altitude and speed restrictions, which must be adhered to unless explicitly canceled by ATC. Pilots should verify clearance levels through instructions such as "**DESCEND VIA STAR**," "**DESCEND UNRESTRICTED**," or "**CANCEL STAR SPEEDS**."

## Runway Assignment
The arrival runway is specified in the Fujairah Arrival ATIS.

## Approach
The standard approach at Fujairah is the ILS, however the expected approach can be found in the Fujairah Arrival ATIS.

## Speeds
The speed limits and recommended speeds within different segments of the Fujairah terminal area is as follows:

|  Speed Range  |              Arrival Segment              |
|:-------------:|:-----------------------------------------:|
| 210 - 250 kts |                 CTA Entry                 |
| 180 - 230 kts |         From downwind to base leg         |
| 160 - 210 kts |                 On base leg               |
|    190 kts    |                Until 10 DME               |
|    160 kts    |                Until 4 DME                |

All speed restrictions must be adhered to as accurately as possible. Aircraft unable to comply with these restrictions must notify ATC in advance and specify the speeds they can maintain. Pilots should also inform ATC if circumstances require a speed adjustment for any reason.

To ensure accurate spacing, pilots are requested to comply with speed adjustments as promptly as practicable, considering their operational constraints.

!!! note
    If traffic sequencing does not require speed limitations, ATC will advise, **NO ATC SPEED RESTRICTION.**

## Taxi
After landing, aircraft must not stop on the rapid exit taxiways and shall continue taxiing according to the following procedures unless otherwise instructed by the tower controller:

- **Runway 29L:** Continue via M, hold short M1.
- **Runway 11R:** Continue via T, hold short T1.
