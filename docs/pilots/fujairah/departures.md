# Departing Traffic
## Flight Planning: Route(s)
Pilots can find valid routes for most flights departing from Ras Al Khaimah on SimBrief by choosing the "Preferred Route" option. Our operations department updates the "Preferred Route" on SimBrief with every AIRAC cycle, ensuring compliance with Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) regulations in the Middle East and Eurocontrol IFPS validation.

### Flight Planning: Standard Instrument Departure (SID)
Controllers will assign a Standard Instrument Departure (SID) based on the first waypoint in your flight plan, guiding you out of the Fujairah Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA). Refer to the table below to see which SID you can expect. If your waypoint isn't listed in the table, ensure your AIRAC cycle is up to date. If your AIRAC is outdated, please inform the controller promptly so we can arrange an omnidirectional departure for you.

|   SID  11R   | Initial Climb |   SID  29L   | Initial Climb |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| IMPED3F      | 6000ft        | IMPED1R      | 6000ft        |
| NOLSU3F      | 6000ft        | IMPED1S      | 6000ft        |
| KASIS2       | 6000ft        | NOLSU1R      | 6000ft        |
| RAV1F        | 6000ft        | RAV1R        | 6000ft        |
| UMAMI3F      | 6000ft        | UMAMI1R      | 6000ft        |
| GABKO4F      | 7000ft        | UMAMI1S      | 6000ft        |
| SERSA4F      | 7000ft        | GABKO1R      | 7000ft        |
| VAVIM2F      | 7000ft        | SERSA1R      | 7000ft        |
| TONVO4F      | 8000ft        | VAVIM1R      | 7000ft        |
|              |               | VAVIM1S      | 7000ft        |
|              |               | TONVO1R      | 8000ft        |

## Getting your clearance
Departing aircraft shall contact Fujairah Ground **10 minutes prior to start-up** and pass the following information:
<ul>
    <li>Aircraft Callsign</li>
    <li>Aircraft Type</li>
    <li>Parking Stand</li>
    <li>Destination</li>
    <li>Standard Instrument Departure (and departure speed if unable to comply with SID minimum speed restrictions)</li>
    <li>Current Departure ATIS Information</li>
</ul>

### Voice Clearance
In Fujairah, voice clearances will be provided. These will be brief, covering only your Standard Instrument Departure (SID), initial climb, and squawk code. Ensure you have the latest departure ATIS information before proceeding.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Fujairah Ground, good evening, IGO99X, Airbus A320, stand 5, requesting IFR Clearance to Mumbai, with information F on board."

    **Controller**: "IGO99X, information F correct, cleared to Mumbai via the TONVO4F departure, maintain altitude 8000ft, squawk 0542."

    **Pilot**: "Cleared to Mumbai, TONVO4F departure, maintain altitude 8000ft, squawk 0542, IGO99X."

    **Controller**: "IGO99X, readback is correct, QNH 1004, report ready for push and start"

## Push & Start
Once you have secured your IFR Clearance, pilots may request push and start clearance whenever they are ready. The ground controller may provide various types of pushback instructions. Pilots must ensure they can comply with these instructions; if unable, they must inform the ground controller.

Pushback clearances will specify a direction to face, such as West or East, and a particular taxiway to push onto.

!!! example
    **Controller**: IGO95C, Fujairah Ground, pushback approved, facing south.

    **Pilot**: Pushback approved, facing south, IGO95C.

!!! warning
    If pilots are unable to commence pushback within 2-3 minutes, the pushback clearance may be revoked.

## Taxi
Pilots must comply with all taxi instructions, including holds. Taxi instructions are given based on various factors such as aircraft type and traffic.

!!! info
    Controllers regularly make use of intermediate holding points to optimise traffic flow. These can be found on the Taxi and Parking charts.

!!! example
    **Controller**: IGO94C, Taxi H, hold D.

### Standard Intersection Departures
For the purposes of takeoff performance planning the standard departure taxiways are:

- **29L**: T1
- **11R**: M1

Crews should base their performance calculations on departure from standard departure points from the notified runway in use if there is no restriction to payload.

ATC may tactically use a different departure point nearer the runway end based on the traffic situation.

## Take-off
### Minimum Runway Occupancy
On receipt of a line-up clearance pilots shall ensure, complying with safety and standard operating procedures, that they are able to line-up on the runway as soon as the preceding aircraft has commenced take-off roll.

Wherever possible, pilots are encouraged to conduct a rolling takeoff to minimise runway occupancy time.
