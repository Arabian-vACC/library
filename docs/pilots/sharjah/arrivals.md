# Arriving Traffic
## Star Assignment
STAR assignments are based on the waypoint at which you enter the Dubai Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA). ATC will assign the appropriate STAR depending on traffic conditions and active runway.

!!! warning
    All STARs into Sharjah include altitude and speed restrictions, which must be adhered to unless explicitly cancelled by ATC. Pilots should verify clearance levels through instructions such as "**DESCEND VIA STAR**," "**DESCEND UNRESTRICTED**," or "**CANCEL STAR SPEEDS**."

## Runway Assignment
The arrival runway is specified in the Sharjah Arrival ATIS, it is determined by the active runway direction at Dubai International Airport.

## Approach
The standard approach at Sharjah is the ILS, however the expected approach can be found in the Sharjah  Arrival ATIS.

## Speeds
The speed limits and recommended speeds within different segments of the Sharjah terminal area is as follows:

|  Speed Range  |              Arrival Segment              |
|:-------------:|:-----------------------------------------:|
| 210 - 250 kts |                 CTA Entry                 |
| 180 - 230 kts |         From downwind to base leg         |
| 160 - 210 kts |                On base leg                |
|    190 kts    |                Until 10 DME               |
|    160 kts    |                Until 4 DME                |

All speed restrictions must be adhered to as accurately as possible. Aircraft unable to comply with these restrictions must notify ATC in advance and specify the speeds they can maintain. Pilots should also inform ATC if circumstances require a speed adjustment for any reason.  

To ensure accurate spacing, pilots are requested to comply with speed adjustments as promptly as practicable, considering their operational constraints.  

If traffic sequencing does not require speed limitations, ATC will advise, “**NO ATC SPEED RESTRICTION**.”  

## Taxi
After landing, aircraft must not stop on the rapid exit taxiways and shall continue taxiing according to the following procedures unless otherwise instructed by the tower controller:

- **Runway 30:** Continue via B, Eastbound
- **Runway 12:** Continue via B, Westbound
