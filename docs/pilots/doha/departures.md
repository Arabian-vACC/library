# Departing Traffic
## Flight Planning: Standard Instrument Departure (SID)
Controllers will assign a Standard Instrument Departure (SID) based on the first waypoint in your flight plan to guide you out of the Doha Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA). Refer to the table below to determine the expected SID. If your waypoint is not listed, ensure your AIRAC cycle is up to date. If using an outdated AIRAC, notify the controller promptly so an RNAV radar-vectored departure or an omnidirectional departure can be arranged.

## Getting your clearance
Departing aircraft shall contact Doha Ground **10 minutes prior to their estimated off block time (EOBT)** and pass the following information:
<ul>
    <li>Aircraft Callsign</li>
    <li>Aircraft Type</li>
    <li>Parking Stand</li>
    <li>Requested Flight Level</li>
    <li>Destination</li>
</ul>

## Datalink Clearance (DCL)
The preferred method for obtaining your clearance is through datalink. To request clearance via Hoppie datalink, send your request to **OTHH**. Please note that logging on to the station is not required. No readback is necessary.

## Voice Clearance
At Doha, if datalink clearances are unavailable, voice clearances will be provided. These will be brief, covering only your Standard Instrument Departure (SID), initial climb, and squawk code. Ensure you have the latest departure ATIS information before proceeding.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Doha Ground, QQE990, Gulfstream 650, information X, stand B3, requesting FL310, to Dubai."

    **Controller**: "QQE990, Doha Ground, information X correct, cleared to Dubai via the  departure, climb via the SID to altitude 3000ft, squawk 2613."

    **Pilot**: "Cleared to Dubai via the ####### departure, climb via the SID to altitude 3000ft, squawk 2613, QTR6M."

    **Controller**: "QTR6M, readback correct, QNH 1016, report ready for pushback."

!!! note "Suspension of Orange Route"
    1. The Orange route shall be suspended when the cloud ceiling is below 2000 FT and/ or visibility is less than 3500 M.
    2. The Orange route shall be suspended during peak arrival periods and IPO.
    3. The OTHH Supervisor may for any other valid reasons suspend the Orange Route.
    4. When the route is suspended, the OTHH ATCO Supervisor shall inform OTBD Tower, the GHC then shall be informed immediately. Best practice is to provide a minimum of
    5. 15 minutesâ€™ notice to GHC.

!!! note Note 1: Aircraft to contact Doha TWR at SML for inbound clearance.
    Note 2: If more than two aircraft requesting to return to Doha from General Flying Area, and they will be required to Hold overhead ZUL for RWY 33 or VLG for RWY 15,        succeeding aircraft will be advised to remain clear of the CTR and standby for joining instruction. Only one aircraft may hold at any one time over ZUL and VLG              respectively. No Holding allowed overhead ASP.
    Note 3: VFR traffic arriving on the ASP arrival are independent of OTHH IFR traffic.
    Note 4: Aircraft proceeding to right base RWY 15 from VLG will maintain 1500 FT until established on final approach to avoid infringing the restricted area over the Amiri Diwan. After establishing the approach, touchdown may be expected approximately abeam intersection TWY Q, with roll-out and vacation at intersection TWY B or TWY B1.
    Note 5: Advanced students or instructors may be able to accomplish touchdown and roll-out earlier than the above, but no attempt should be made to request this from the pilot.

### Push & Start
Once clearance delivery releases you to the designated ground frequency, pilots may request push and start clearance. Upon initial contact, the ground controller may provide various types of pushback instructions. Pilots must ensure they can comply with these instructions; if unable, they must inform the ground controller.

Pushback clearances will specify a direction to face, such as West or East, and a particular taxiway to push onto.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "QQE990, push and start is approved face south onto taxiway D1."

!!! warning
    If pilots are unable to commence pushback within 2-3 minutes, the pushback clearance may be revoked, and slot times will be recalculated.

## Taxi
### Standard Intersection Departures
For the purposes of takeoff performance planning the standard departure taxiways are:

- **Runway 15:** A
- **Runway 33:** F, G

Crews should base their performance calculations on departure from standard departure points from the notified runway in use if there is no restriction to payload.

ATC may tactically use a different departure point nearer the runway end based on the traffic situation.

## Take-off
### Minimum Runway Occupancy
On receipt of a line-up clearance pilots shall ensure, complying with safety and standard operating procedures, that they are able to line-up on the runway as soon as the preceding aircraft has commenced take-off roll.

Wherever possible, pilots are encouraged to conduct a rolling takeoff to minimise runway occupancy time.
