Doha International Airport is located in Doha, Qatar. It served as Qatar's primary commercial international airport until the opening of Hamad International Airport on 27 May 2014. Although regular commercial traffic has ceased, the airport and its existing runway are still utilized by the Qatar Emiri Air Force, Qatar Amiri Flight, Rizon Jet, Gulf Helicopters, and Qatar Aeronautical College. Additionally, it functions as a state/diplomatic airport, accommodating both Qatar Amiri Flight and state visit flights. On 15 September 2022, the airport resumed commercial flights for select airlines to manage increased traffic for the 2022 FIFA World Cup hosted by Qatar in November.

!!! Warning
    It's crucial that you pay close attention to the frequency you're being transferred to. Do not attempt to guess the next frequency, and never switch frequencies without explicit instructions from the controller. Auto-handoffs are issued with the take-off clearance at Doha-Hamad International. If you're unsure, don’t hesitate to ask for the frequency again!
## Departing Traffic
#### Flight Planning: Standard Instrument Departure (SID)
Controllers will assign a Standard Instrument Departure (SID) based on the first waypoint in your flight plan to guide you out of the Doha Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA). Refer to the table below to determine the expected SID. If your waypoint is not listed, ensure your AIRAC cycle is up to date. If using an outdated AIRAC, notify the controller promptly so an RNAV radar-vectored departure or an omnidirectional departure can be arranged.

!!! Note
    The departures listed above are runway-specific and cannot be used on any runway other than those published. As a result, your clearance will not specify a designated runway. Pilots must cross-check their charts to determine their assigned departure runway. For example, if parked on Apron 6 and assigned Runway 34R, expect a long taxi.

### Getting your clearance
Departing aircraft shall contact Hamad Clearance Delivery **10 minutes prior to their estimated off block time (EOBT)** and pass the following information:
<ul>
    <li>Aircraft Callsign</li>
    <li>Aircraft Type</li>
    <li>Parking Stand</li>
    <li>Requested Flight Level</li>
    <li>Destination</li>
</ul>

#### Datalink Clearance (DCL)
The preferred method for obtaining your clearance is through datalink. To request clearance via Hoppie datalink, send your request to **OTHH**. Please note that logging on to the station is not required. No readback is necessary.

#### Voice Clearance
At Doha-Hamad, if datalink clearances are unavailable, voice clearances will be provided. These will be brief, covering only your Standard Instrument Departure (SID), initial climb, and squawk code. Ensure you have the latest departure ATIS information before proceeding.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Hamad Clearance Delivery, QTR6M, Boeing 777-300ER, information X, stand B3, requesting FL310, to Melbourne."

    **Controller**: "QTR6M, Doha Ground, information X correct, cleared to Dubai via the ######## departure, climb via the SID to altitude 3000ft, squawk 2613."

    **Pilot**: "Cleared to Dubai via the ####### departure, climb via the SID to altitude 3000ft, squawk 2613, QTR6M."

    **Controller**: "QTR6M, readback correct, QNH 1016, report ready for pushback."

!!! warning
    Clearance delivery will not provide push and start clearance. However, remain on the clearance delivery frequency; do not switch to the ground frequency on your own. You must report fully ready on the delivery frequency—this includes having the jetway disconnected, tug connected, and chocks removed. Delivery will advise when to switch to the appropriate ground frequency, based on the current airport departure rate.

### Push & Start
Once clearance delivery releases you to the designated ground frequency, pilots may request push and start clearance. Upon initial contact, the ground controller may provide various types of pushback instructions. Pilots must ensure they can comply with these instructions; if unable, they must inform the ground controller.

Pushback clearances will specify a direction to face, such as West or East, and a particular taxiway to push onto.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "QTR6M, push and start is approved face south onto taxiway E1."

!!! warning
    If pilots are unable to commence pushback within 2-3 minutes, the pushback clearance may be revoked, and slot times will be recalculated.

### Taxi
#### Standard Intersection Departures
For the purposes of takeoff performance planning the standard departure taxiways are:

- **Runway 16L:** A10
- **Runway 16R:** L10, M11, M12
- **Runway 34L:** L2, M3, M4
- **Runway 34R:** A2

Crews should base their performance calculations on departure from standard departure points from the notified runway in use if there is no restriction to payload.

ATC may tactically use a different departure point nearer the runway end based on the traffic situation.

</figure>

### Take-off
#### Auto-Handoff
Pilots will receive their next frequency with their takeoff clearance and are expected to contact the assigned frequency once airborne. If unsure of the assigned frequency, pilots should refer to their SID chart for the appropriate station or confirm with the controller.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "QTR6M, airborne contact Doha Approach on 124.775, wind 350 degrees at 8 knots, runway 34R, cleared for take-off."

#### Minimum Runway Occupancy
On receipt of a line-up clearance pilots shall ensure, complying with safety and standard operating procedures, that they are able to line-up on the runway as soon as the preceding aircraft has commenced take-off roll.

Wherever possible, pilots are encouraged to conduct a rolling takeoff to minimise runway occupancy time.

## Arriving Traffic
### STAR Assignment
STAR assignments are based on the waypoint at which you enter the Doha Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA). The table below outlines the possible STARs for each entry point. ATC will assign the appropriate STAR depending on traffic conditions, with a preference for the shortest available routing whenever possible.

!!! note
    It is essential to highlight that the following arrival procedures are applicable to both Doha (OTBD) and Hamad (OTHH) airports. These procedures are not airport-specific.  

    Aircraft can be sequenced on any of the STARs that guide them either to the east or west downwinds, depending on sector capacity.

!!! warning
    All STARs into Doha-Hamad include altitude and speed restrictions, which must be adhered to unless explicitly canceled by ATC. Pilots should verify clearance levels through instructions such as "**DESCEND VIA STAR**," "**DESCEND UNRESTRICTED**," or "**CANCEL STAR SPEEDS**."

### Runway Assignment
Runway assignments are issued by Doha Radar or Doha Approach and may be given with short notice during high-traffic periods. Pilots should be prepared for all arrival runways listed in the ATIS.

If the aircraft supports a secondary flight plan, pilots should preload an alternate arrival runway to facilitate a swift transition if required.

### Approach
The standard approach at Doha-Hamad is the ILS, with independent parallel operations in effect. Pilots can expect a minimum diagonal separation of 3 NM from traffic on the opposite runway and 2 NM spacing from preceding aircraft on the opposite runway.

### Speeds
The speed limits and recommended speeds within different segments of the Doha terminal area is as follows:

|  Speed Range  |              Arrival Segment              |
|:-------------:|:-----------------------------------------:|
| 230 - 210 kts |           Initial approach phase          |
|    180 kts    | Base leg/closed heading to final approach |
|    180 kts    |                Until 10 DME               |
|    160 kts    |                Until 4 DME                |

!!! note
    Aircraft subject to speed restrictions on final with DME constraints may be instructed by ATC to comply with "**STANDARD SPEEDS**" meaning pilots are expected to maintain these speeds until final approach.  

    For the A380, the speed sequence is as follows: 180 until 10 DME and 160 kts until 5 DME.

All speed restrictions must be adhered to as accurately as possible. Aircraft unable to comply with these restrictions must notify ATC in advance and specify the speeds they can maintain. Pilots should also inform ATC if circumstances require a speed adjustment for any reason.  

To ensure accurate spacing, pilots are requested to comply with speed adjustments as promptly as practicable, considering their operational constraints.  

If traffic sequencing does not require speed limitations, ATC will advise, “**NO ATC SPEED RESTRICTION**.”  

### Landing
#### High Intensity Runway Operations (HIRO)
During peak traffic periods, rapid runway vacating is essential to prevent go-arounds for following aircraft. Ensure your entire aircraft has passed the designated runway holding point before considering yourself clear. Avoid unnecessary stops before exiting completely.

All rapid exit taxiways are equipped with rapid taxiway indicator lights. Pilots are encouraged to maintain the designated exit taxi speed of 50 knots.

| Runway |     Standard Rapid Exit   |
|:------:|:-------------------------:|
|   16L  |            A7             |
|   16R  |            M7             |
|   34L  |            M8             |
|   34R  |            A5             |

!!! warning
    Do not vacate the runway via A6 or L7 unless explicitly instructed by ATC.

!!! info
    Pilots are expected to vacate the runway using standard exit procedures unless instructed otherwise by the tower controller. If unable to comply with High-Intensity Runway Operations (HIRO), advise tower on first contact.

#### ILS Glidepath Fluctuations
Aircraft arriving on Runway 34L may experience glidepath signal fluctuations due to taxiing and departing aircraft. Pilots should be prepared for potential glidepath interference and closely monitor their ILS profile, flight display indications, and autopilot behavior during both manual and coupled ILS approaches.

### Taxi
After landing, aircraft must not stop on the rapid exit taxiways and shall continue taxiing according to the following procedures unless otherwise instructed by the tower controller:  

- **Runway 16L:** Continue via B southbound.  
- **Runway 16R:** Continue via K or M southbound.  
- **Runway 16R (Apron 5 Parking):** Expect a northbound turn onto K (HIRO not applicable).  
- **Runway 34L:** Continue via M northbound unless instructed to vacate to the east (if vacating east, HIRO not applicable).  
- **Runway 34R:** Continue via B northbound.

## Arriving Traffic
### STAR Assignment
STAR assignments are based on the waypoint at which you enter the Doha Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA). The table below outlines the possible STARs for each entry point. ATC will assign the appropriate STAR depending on traffic conditions, with a preference for the shortest available routing whenever possible.

!!! note
    It is essential to highlight that the following arrival procedures are applicable to both Doha (OTBD) and Hamad (OTHH) airports. These procedures are not airport-specific.  

    Aircraft can be sequenced on any of the STARs that guide them either to the east or west downwinds, depending on sector capacity.
