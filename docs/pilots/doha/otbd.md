Doha International Airport is located in Doha, Qatar. It served as Qatar's primary commercial international airport until the opening of Hamad International Airport on 27 May 2014. Although regular commercial traffic has ceased, the airport and its existing runway are still utilized by the Qatar Emiri Air Force, Qatar Amiri Flight, Rizon Jet, Gulf Helicopters, and Qatar Aeronautical College. Additionally, it functions as a state/diplomatic airport, accommodating both Qatar Amiri Flight and state visit flights. On 15 September 2022, the airport resumed commercial flights for select airlines to manage increased traffic for the 2022 FIFA World Cup hosted by Qatar in November.

!!! Warning
    It's crucial that you pay close attention to the frequency you're being transferred to. Do not attempt to guess the next frequency, and never switch frequencies without explicit instructions from the controller. Auto-handoffs are issued with the take-off clearance at Doha-Hamad International. If you're unsure, don’t hesitate to ask for the frequency again!
## Departing Traffic
### Flight Planning: Route(s)
Pilots departing from Doha-Hamad can obtain valid routes through SimBrief by selecting the "Preferred Route" or "IFPS Compliant Route" option. Our operations department updates the SimBrief database with each AIRAC cycle to ensure compliance with Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) regulations in the Middle East and Eurocontrol IFPS validation.

<figure markdown>
![Simbrief Preferred Route](img/simbrief_ifps_route.png){ width="600" }
!!! example
    **Controller**: "QTR6M, airborne contact Doha Approach on 124.775, wind 350 degrees at 8 knots, runway 34R, cleared for take-off."

#### Minimum Runway Occupancy
On receipt of a line-up clearance pilots shall ensure, complying with safety and standard operating procedures, that they are able to line-up on the runway as soon as the preceding aircraft has commenced take-off roll.

Wherever possible, pilots are encouraged to conduct a rolling takeoff to minimise runway occupancy time.

#### Reduced Runway Separation Minima (RRSM)
Reduced runway separation may be implemented at any time, day or night, under the following scenarios:

- A departing aircraft followed by another aircraft departing from the same runway.
- Two consecutive landing aircraft.
- Two consecutive departing aircraft.

##### Conditions for Application:

- The tailwind component does not exceed **5 knots** at the landing threshold, and there are no pilot reports of **wind shear**.
- Meteorological visibility is at least **5000 metres**, and the cloud ceiling is not below **1000 feet**. The AIR controller must be confident that the following aircraft can **continuously and completely observe** the relevant traffic.
- Traffic information is provided to the crew of the **succeeding aircraft**.
- The runway is **dry**, with no indications that braking action will be adversely affected.
- The AIR controller must be able to assess separation **visually** or using **radar-derived information**.
- Suitable **landmarks and surface surveillance markers** must be available to assist in assessing aircraft separation.
- **Wake turbulence separation minima** must be maintained.
- **Minimum separation** must still exist between two departing aircraft **immediately after** the second aircraft takes off.
- The pilot of an arriving aircraft must be informed of the **expected exit point** for runway vacating.

## Arriving Traffic
### STAR Assignment
STAR assignments are based on the waypoint at which you enter the Doha Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA). The table below outlines the possible STARs for each entry point. ATC will assign the appropriate STAR depending on traffic conditions, with a preference for the shortest available routing whenever possible.

!!! note
    It is essential to highlight that the following arrival procedures are applicable to both Doha (OTBD) and Hamad (OTHH) airports. These procedures are not airport-specific.  

    Aircraft can be sequenced on any of the STARs that guide them either to the east or west downwinds, depending on sector capacity.

|  VEDED1V  | Direct to Downwind |  Short |   East   |

!!! warning
    All STARs into Doha-Hamad include altitude and speed restrictions, which must be adhered to unless explicitly canceled by ATC. Pilots should verify clearance levels through instructions such as "**DESCEND VIA STAR**," "**DESCEND UNRESTRICTED**," or "**CANCEL STAR SPEEDS**."

### Runway Assignment
Runway assignments are issued by Doha Radar or Doha Approach and may be given with short notice during high-traffic periods. Pilots should be prepared for all arrival runways listed in the ATIS.

If the aircraft supports a secondary flight plan, pilots should preload an alternate arrival runway to facilitate a swift transition if required.

### Approach
The standard approach at Doha-Hamad is the ILS, with independent parallel operations in effect. Pilots can expect a minimum diagonal separation of 3 NM from traffic on the opposite runway and 2 NM spacing from preceding aircraft on the opposite runway.

### Speeds
The speed limits and recommended speeds within different segments of the Doha terminal area is as follows:

|  Speed Range  |              Arrival Segment              |
|:-------------:|:-----------------------------------------:|
| 230 - 210 kts |           Initial approach phase          |
|    180 kts    | Base leg/closed heading to final approach |
|    180 kts    |                Until 10 DME               |
|    160 kts    |                Until 4 DME                |

!!! note
    Aircraft subject to speed restrictions on final with DME constraints may be instructed by ATC to comply with "**STANDARD SPEEDS**" meaning pilots are expected to maintain these speeds until final approach.  

    For the A380, the speed sequence is as follows: 180 until 10 DME and 160 kts until 5 DME.

All speed restrictions must be adhered to as accurately as possible. Aircraft unable to comply with these restrictions must notify ATC in advance and specify the speeds they can maintain. Pilots should also inform ATC if circumstances require a speed adjustment for any reason.  

To ensure accurate spacing, pilots are requested to comply with speed adjustments as promptly as practicable, considering their operational constraints.  

If traffic sequencing does not require speed limitations, ATC will advise, “**NO ATC SPEED RESTRICTION**.”  

### Landing
#### High Intensity Runway Operations (HIRO)
During peak traffic periods, rapid runway vacating is essential to prevent go-arounds for following aircraft. Ensure your entire aircraft has passed the designated runway holding point before considering yourself clear. Avoid unnecessary stops before exiting completely.

All rapid exit taxiways are equipped with rapid taxiway indicator lights. Pilots are encouraged to maintain the designated exit taxi speed of 50 knots.

| Runway |     Standard Rapid Exit   |
|:------:|:-------------------------:|
|   16L  |            A7             |
|   16R  |            M7             |
|   34L  |            M8             |
|   34R  |            A5             |

!!! warning
    Do not vacate the runway via A6 or L7 unless explicitly instructed by ATC.

!!! info
    Pilots are expected to vacate the runway using standard exit procedures unless instructed otherwise by the tower controller. If unable to comply with High-Intensity Runway Operations (HIRO), advise tower on first contact.

#### ILS Glidepath Fluctuations
Aircraft arriving on Runway 34L may experience glidepath signal fluctuations due to taxiing and departing aircraft. Pilots should be prepared for potential glidepath interference and closely monitor their ILS profile, flight display indications, and autopilot behavior during both manual and coupled ILS approaches.

### Taxi
After landing, aircraft must not stop on the rapid exit taxiways and shall continue taxiing according to the following procedures unless otherwise instructed by the tower controller:  

- **Runway 16L:** Continue via B southbound.  
- **Runway 16R:** Continue via K or M southbound.  
- **Runway 16R (Apron 5 Parking):** Expect a northbound turn onto K (HIRO not applicable).  
- **Runway 34L:** Continue via M northbound unless instructed to vacate to the east (if vacating east, HIRO not applicable).  
- **Runway 34R:** Continue via B northbound.
