Doha International Airport is located in Doha, Qatar. It served as Qatar's primary commercial international airport until the opening of Hamad International Airport on 27 May 2014. Although regular commercial traffic has ceased, the airport and its existing runway are still utilized by the Qatar Emiri Air Force, Qatar Amiri Flight, Rizon Jet, Gulf Helicopters, and Qatar Aeronautical College. Additionally, it functions as a state/diplomatic airport, accommodating both Qatar Amiri Flight and state visit flights. On 15 September 2022, the airport resumed commercial flights for select airlines to manage increased traffic for the 2022 FIFA World Cup hosted by Qatar in November.

!!! Warning
    It's crucial that you pay close attention to the frequency you're being transferred to. Do not attempt to guess the next frequency, and never switch frequencies without explicit instructions from the controller. Auto-handoffs are issued with the take-off clearance at Doha-Hamad International. If you're unsure, donâ€™t hesitate to ask for the frequency again!
