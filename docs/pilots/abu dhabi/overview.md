## Stand Assignments
Since 2023, passenger operations have been based out of Terminal A. Passenger aircraft can expect to be allocated to Apron 6, unless traffic constraints mean overflow parking needs to be utilised

!!! Warning
    It's crucial that you pay close attention to the frequency you're being transferred to. Do not attempt to guess the next frequency, and never switch frequencies without explicit instructions from the controller. Auto-handoffs are not used at Dubai International. If you're unsure, donâ€™t hesitate to ask for the frequency again!

## Reduced Runway Separation Minima (RRSM)
Reduced runway separation may be implemented at any time, day or night, under the following scenarios:

- A departing aircraft followed by another aircraft departing from the same runway.
- Two consecutive landing aircraft.
- Two consecutive departing aircraft.

### Conditions for Application:

- The tailwind component does not exceed **5 knots** at the landing threshold, and there are no pilot reports of **wind shear**.
- Meteorological visibility is at least **5000 metres**, and the cloud ceiling is not below **1000 feet**. The AIR controller must be confident that the following aircraft can **continuously and completely observe** the relevant traffic.
- Traffic information is provided to the crew of the **succeeding aircraft**.
- The runway is **dry**, with no indications that braking action will be adversely affected.
- The AIR controller must be able to assess separation **visually** or using **radar-derived information**.
- Suitable **landmarks and surface surveillance markers** must be available to assist in assessing aircraft separation.
- **Wake turbulence separation minima** must be maintained.
- **Minimum separation** must still exist between two departing aircraft **immediately after** the second aircraft takes off.
- The pilot of an arriving aircraft must be informed of the **expected exit point** for runway vacating.
