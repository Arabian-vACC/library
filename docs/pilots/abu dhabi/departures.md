# Departing Traffic
!!! success
    All pilots should also familiarise themeselves with the [Airport Overview](overview)
    
## Flight Planning: Route(s)
Pilots can find valid routes for most flights departing from Abu Dhabi on SimBrief by choosing the "Preferred Route" option. Our operations department updates the "Preferred Route" on SimBrief with every AIRAC cycle, ensuring compliance with Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) regulations in the Middle East and Eurocontrol IFPS validation.

## Flight Planning: Standard Instrument Departure (SID)
Controllers will assign a Standard Instrument Departure (SID) based on the first waypoint in your flight plan, guiding you out of the Abu Dhabi Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA). Refer to the table below to see which SID you can expect. If your waypoint isn't listed in the table, ensure your AIRAC cycle is up to date. If your AIRAC is outdated, please inform the controller promptly so we can arrange an omnidirectional departure for you.

|    Fix    | RWY 13L | RWY 13R | RWY 31L     | RWY 31R   |
|-----------|---------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **ATUDO** | 5F      | 5G      | 4K/1U       | 3P        |
| **BOSEV** | 1F      | 1G      | 1K          | 1P        |
| **DAXIB** | 1F      | 1G      | 1K          | 1P        |
| **KANIP** | 3F      | 3G      | 4K/2U       | 1N/3P     |
| **LORID** | 1F      | 1G      | 2K          | 1P        |
| **MEKRI** | 1F      | 1G      | 2K          | 1P        |

## Getting your clearance
### Datalink Clearance (DCL)
The preferred method for obtaining your clearance is through datalink. Datalink clearances should be requested no less than 20 minutes prior to EOBT. To request clearance via Hoppie datalink, send your request to **OMAA**. Pilots shall acknowledge DCL and report ready for pushback with **Abu Dhabi Delivery**

!!! info
    During slotted events, pilots should contact Abu Dhabi Delivery at **TSAT +/- 2 mins, confirming ready for pushback**

### Voice Clearance
Departing aircraft requiring clearance via voice shall contact Abu Dhabi Delivery **when ready for pushback** and pass the following information:

<ul>
    <li>Aircraft Callsign (including the word "Heavy" or "Super" as necessary)</li>
    <li>Aircraft Type</li>
    <li>Parking Stand</li>
    <li>Ready for push and start</li>
    <li>Current ATIS information</li>
</ul>

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Abu Dhabi Delivery, good evening, ETD93C HEAVY, Airbus A350-1000, stand 610, ready for push and start, information A on board"

    **Controller**: "ETD93C, cleared to Chicago via the DAXIB1P departure, maintain altitude 5000ft, when airborne contact Abu Dhabi Radar on 128.100, squawk 0676."

    **Pilot**: "Cleared to Chicago, DAXIB1P departure, maintain altitude 5000ft, when airborne contact Abu Dhabi Radar on 128.100, squawk 0676, ETD93C."

    **Controller**: "ETD93C, readback is correct, QNH 1004. Hold position, monitor Abu Dhabi Ground on frequency 120.425"

!!! warning
    Confirmation that you are "ready for pushback" requires that the tug is attached and you are able to push immediately upon receipt of clearance

## Push and Start
Once push and start clearance is received, it is valid for 1 minute - pilots must ensure that pushback commences promptly. ATC may cancel or delay a pushback clearance based on operational requirements. Tug release points are in use at Abu Dhabi, however these will not be mentioned in push clearances. Pushback clearance will include

!!! info
    The iniBuilds Abu Dhabi GSX profile (available through IniManager) includes most of the pushback clearances you can expect. If you don't have this profile installed, ensure you can follow the pushback instructions using the GSX Quick Edit option.

## Taxi
Pilots must comply with all taxi instructions, including holds. Taxi instructions are given based on various factors such as aircraft type and traffic.

!!! info
    Controllers regularly make use of intermediate holding points to optimise traffic flow. These can be found on the **Taxi and Parking** charts.

### Standard Intersection Departures
As standard, pilots should expect full runway length departures from the following holding points:

| Runway | Standard departure points |
|:------:|:-------------------------:|
| 31R    | A16/A17/A18               |
| 31L    | D11/E15                   |
| 13L    | A1/A2/A3                  |
| 13R    | D1/E2                     |

Intersection departures may be available upon request to ATC. Please advise the GMC controller at the earliest opportunity if pilots would like to request an intersection in order for them to coordinate this with the relevant upper controller.

### Minimum Runway Occupancy
On receipt of a line-up clearance pilots shall ensure, complying with safety and standard operating procedures, that they are able to line-up on the runway as soon as the preceding aircraft has commenced take-off roll.

Wherever possible, pilots are encouraged to conduct a rolling takeoff to minimise runway occupancy time.

## Take Off
### Minimum Runway Occupancy
On receipt of a line-up clearance pilots shall ensure, complying with safety and standard operating procedures, that they are able to line-up on the runway as soon as the preceding aircraft has commenced take-off roll.

Wherever possible, pilots are encouraged to conduct a rolling takeoff to minimise runway occupancy time.

### Auto Handoff Procedure
Automatic handoffs are used at Abu Dhabi. The airborne frequency will have been provided during the clearance procedure, and upon passing 1000 ft, pilots should contact Abu Dhabi Radar with the following information (unless otherwise instructed by Abu Dhabi Tower):

<ul>
    <li> Aircraft Callsign </li>
    <li> Passing Level </li>
    <li> SID </li>
</ul>
