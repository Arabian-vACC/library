Dubai International Airport is the primary gateway for Dubai and the United Arab Emirates. It ranks as the world's busiest airport by international passenger traffic and is also the largest airport in the Middle East. Globally, it is the second busiest by total passenger volume and the leading airport for Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 operations.

Located 2.54 nautical miles east of Dubai's city center in the Al Garhoud district, the airport is home to Emirates Airline and low-cost carrier FlyDubai.

!!! Tip
    Dubai International is one of the busiest globally and the most active in the Middle East. Due to the high volume of traffic during peak hours and the airport's operational complexity, **it is essential that you prepare thoroughly**, as any professional crew would. Be sure to review this brief and the corresponding charts carefully.

    **If you are new to the VATSIM Network**, we strongly recommend avoiding this airport until you have gained more experience flying on the network. During peak times, controllers are often too busy to offer additional assistance. Instead, consider flying to other airports within the Arabian vACC, where the traffic is lighter and procedures are less complex, allowing for a more accommodating experience.

!!! Warning
    The latest airport layout is reflected in MSFS, X-Plane, and the freeware Prepar3D sceneries. However, the payware Prepar3D scenery from FlyTampa features the 2012 airport layout, which lacks Concourse D and some taxiways/rapid-exits. Pilots using the FlyTampa scenery must inform the controller of this on initial contact.

!!! Warning
    It's crucial that you pay close attention to the frequency you're being transferred to. Do not attempt to guess the next frequency, and never switch frequencies without explicit instructions from the controller. Auto-handoffs are not used at Dubai International. If you're unsure, donâ€™t hesitate to ask for the frequency again!

## Reduced Runway Separation Minima (RRSM)
Reduced runway separation may be implemented at any time, day or night, under the following scenarios:

- A departing aircraft followed by another aircraft departing from the same runway.
- Two consecutive landing aircraft.
- Two consecutive departing aircraft.

### Conditions for Application:

- The tailwind component does not exceed **5 knots** at the landing threshold, and there are no pilot reports of **wind shear**.
- Meteorological visibility is at least **5000 metres**, and the cloud ceiling is not below **1000 feet**. The AIR controller must be confident that the following aircraft can **continuously and completely observe** the relevant traffic.
- Traffic information is provided to the crew of the **succeeding aircraft**.
- The runway is **dry**, with no indications that braking action will be adversely affected.
- The AIR controller must be able to assess separation **visually** or using **radar-derived information**.
- Suitable **landmarks and surface surveillance markers** must be available to assist in assessing aircraft separation.
- **Wake turbulence separation minima** must be maintained.
- **Minimum separation** must still exist between two departing aircraft **immediately after** the second aircraft takes off.
- The pilot of an arriving aircraft must be informed of the **expected exit point** for runway vacating.
