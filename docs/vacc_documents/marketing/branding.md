## Scope
Welcome to the **Arabian vACC Branding Guidelines**. This document serves as a comprehensive guide for anyone creating, applying, or simply interested in our branding. Whether you are designing event banners, preparing announcements, or developing new marketing content, these guidelines outline the standards, practices, and expectations that ensure our brand remains consistent and professional.  

Our branding represents not only the Arabian vACC, but also the wider VATMENA Division and its reputation within the VATSIM community. Through unified design standards, clear visual identity, and consistent application, we aim to deliver a professional image that strengthens recognition and trust across all of our events, services, and communications.  

This policy provides practical direction on **fonts, colors, logos, banners, announcements, and event materials** â€” including both what to do and what to avoid. By following these standards, we ensure that every piece of content we release contributes to a strong and cohesive identity for the Arabian vACC.

## The thoughts behind the logo
The logo was designed by **Naman Gaur (1506377)** following the merger of the **Bahrain & Qatar, Emirates, and Muscat vACCs**. It features a modern, clean, and professional design, emphasizing clarity and precision. The design incorporates an oryx, symbolizing the unity of the three countries, and is minimalistic, reinforcing simplicity and elegance. 

The white color suggests neutrality, simplicity, and versatility, providing high contrast on darker backgrounds and making the logo adaptable for various digital and print applications. Chrome yellow represents the desert, optimism, and energy, aligning with the vACCâ€™s hashtags: #clearmission & #clearvision
