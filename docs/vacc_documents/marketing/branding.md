## Scope
Welcome to the **Arabian vACC Branding Policy**. This document serves as a comprehensive guide for anyone creating, applying, or simply interested in our branding. Whether you are designing event banners, preparing announcements, or developing new marketing content, these guidelines outline the standards, practices, and expectations that ensure our brand remains consistent and professional.  

Our branding represents not only the Arabian vACC, but also the wider VATMENA Division and its reputation within the VATSIM community. Through unified design standards, clear visual identity, and consistent application, we aim to deliver a professional image that strengthens recognition and trust across all of our events, services, and communications.  

This policy provides practical direction on **fonts, colors, logos, banners, announcements, and event materials** — including both what to do and what to avoid. By following these standards, we ensure that every piece of content we release contributes to a strong and cohesive identity for the Arabian vACC.  

!!! warning  
    All branding material and documentation contained in this section is intended solely for use by the Arabian vACC. Unauthorized use, duplication, or modification outside of the vACC is strictly prohibited.  

## General Guidelines
### Title & Logo
Event titles must be **clear and easy to read**, ensuring members immediately understand what the event is about. The **Arabian vACC logo** must be clearly displayed using the correct variation for the background, and its usage must follow our [branding guidelines](https://library.arabian-vacc.com/vacc_documents/marketing/branding/).  

The **VATMENA logo** must also be displayed in accordance with the Division’s marketing guidelines. All logos should be **well-spaced** and presented at the **same size** for consistency and professionalism.

### Information
Dates must be written in the **day, month format** (e.g. *19th August*). For **repeating events**, the weekday should also be included.  

If the banner is a **controller examination**, the title must specify whether it is a **rating exam** or an **endorsement exam** (e.g. *Tier-1 Validation*).  

Event airports must always be listed with their **ICAO/IATA codes** (e.g. *OTHH/DOH*) to ensure recognition.  

Times must be provided in **24-hour Zulu format**, including both a **start** and **end time**.

### Export
All banners must be created in a **16:9 ratio** to comply with myVATSIM’s upload requirements.  

If images are used, ensure you have **permission to use them on behalf of the vACC**, or provide proper credit. When credit is required, the **author and credit must be clearly included on the banner** in ***bold and italics***, placed in a corner.

### Controller Examination Banners
Controller examination banners are subject to **stricter requirements**. Only the **official template** and **approved backgrounds** may be used.  

The **titles and descriptions** of controller examinations must strictly follow the [**policy set by the Marketing Department**]().

### Colors
Please use the **color palette defined in the branding guidelines**. Variations in **shades of the primary colors** are permitted.
