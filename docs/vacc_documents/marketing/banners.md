## Scope
Welcome to the **Arabian vACC Banner Guidelines**. This document provides clear standards for the design and presentation of all Arabian vACC event materials, ensuring consistency, professionalism, and alignment with both vACC and VATMENA branding requirements.  

Through consistent application of these rules, the Arabian vACC demonstrates professionalism, strengthens the VATMENA Division’s reputation, and provides members with clear, reliable, and visually coherent event communication.  

!!! warning  
    All event branding material and documentation contained in this section is intended solely for use by the Arabian vACC. Unauthorized use, duplication, or modification outside of the vACC is strictly prohibited.  

## General Guidelines
### Title & Logo
Event titles must be **clear and easy to read**, ensuring members immediately understand what the event is about. The **Arabian vACC logo** must be clearly displayed using the correct variation for the background, and its usage must follow our [branding guidelines](https://library.arabian-vacc.com/vacc_documents/marketing/branding/).  

The **VATMENA logo** must also be displayed in accordance with the Division’s marketing guidelines. All logos should be **well-spaced** and presented at the **same size** for consistency and professionalism.

### Information
Dates must be written in the **day, month format** (e.g. *19th August*). For **repeating events**, the weekday should also be included.  

If the banner is a **controller examination**, the title must specify whether it is a **rating exam** or an **endorsement exam** (e.g. *Tier-1 Validation*).  

Event airports must always be listed with their **ICAO/IATA codes** (e.g. *OTHH/DOH*) to ensure recognition.  

Times must be provided in **24-hour Zulu format**, including both a **start** and **end time**.

### Export
All banners must be created in a **16:9 ratio** to comply with myVATSIM’s upload requirements.  

If images are used, ensure you have **permission to use them on behalf of the vACC**, or provide proper credit. When credit is required, the **author and credit must be clearly included on the banner** in ***bold and italics***, placed in a corner.

### Controller Examination Banners
Controller examination banners are subject to **stricter requirements**. Only the **official template** and **approved backgrounds** may be used.  

The **titles and descriptions** of controller examinations must strictly follow the [**policy set by the Marketing Department**]().

### Colors
Please use the **color palette defined in the branding guidelines**. Variations in **shades of the primary colors** are permitted.
