## Scope
Welcome to the **Arabian vACC General Guidelines**. This document provides clear standards for the design and presentation of all Arabian vACC event materials, ensuring consistency, professionalism, and alignment with both vACC and VATMENA branding requirements.  

Whether you are preparing an event banner, creating a controller examination announcement, or publishing promotional content, these guidelines set out the rules for **titles, logos, event information, exports, controller examination materials, and color usage**. By following this policy, we ensure that every event we promote delivers a unified, professional image that strengthens recognition within the VATSIM community.  

This policy highlights the importance of **readable titles, correct logo usage, standardized date and time formats, approved export dimensions, and color consistency**. Special requirements for **controller examination banners** are also outlined to maintain the highest level of quality and compliance.  

Through consistent application of these rules, the Arabian vACC demonstrates professionalism, strengthens the VATMENA Division’s reputation, and provides members with clear, reliable, and visually coherent event communication.  

!!! warning  
    All event branding material and documentation contained in this section is intended solely for use by the Arabian vACC. Unauthorized use, duplication, or modification outside of the vACC is strictly prohibited.  

## General Guidelines
### Event Marketing
Events organized by the **Arabian vACC** or those in which the vACC participates are published through the following channels:

- **Arabian vACC Discord** ([community.vatsim.net](https://community.vatsim.net))  
    - Discord Calendar & Announcements  
- **VATMENA Discord** ([community.vatsim.net](https://community.vatsim.net))  
    - Discord Calendar & Announcements  
- **Arabian vACC Social Media**  
    - **X/Twitter:** [https://x.com/arabianvacc](https://x.com/arabianvacc)  
    - **Facebook:** [https://www.facebook.com/arabianvacc/](https://www.facebook.com/arabianvacc/)  
    - **Instagram:** [https://www.instagram.com/arabianvacc](https://www.instagram.com/arabianvacc)  
- **myVATSIM Events Calendar** ([my.vatsim.net](https://my.vatsim.net))  

The Marketing Department strives to:

- Publish **controller examinations** with at least **2 weeks’ notice**.  
- Publish **events** with at least **4 weeks’ notice**.  
- Publish **rosters** for rostered events **no later than the night before** the event.  

Requests for ATC coverage from **virtual airlines** or other vACCs are generally **not published in the calendar** and usually require only a staffing announcement.

### Event Types
**Open Signup Events**  
- Position assignment is on a **first-come, first-served** basis; each controller books individually.  
- **Rostering is not used**.  
- The **Marketing General Guidelines does not apply**.  
- Examples: ATC requests or small events.  

**Rostered Events**  
- Controllers can **express their position preferences** when signing up.  
- **Rostering is used**, and positions are assigned in bulk by the Marketing Department.  
- The **Marketing General Guidelines applies**.  
- Examples: Medium to large events.

### Event Signup
Every event or controller examination will have a dedicated staffing post created using the forum feature on the Arabian vACC Discord server.  

Controllers are expected to:  

- Clearly indicate their availability when signing up, using the provided signup template if one is given. Include your current rating and any relevant endorsements.  
- Promptly update your availability if any changes occur and notify the Marketing Department accordingly. Refer to the **Cancellations and No-Shows** section for guidance.  
- Ensure that you hold the necessary rating and endorsements for any position you choose or request.  

#### Solo Validations
Controllers who wish to staff a position using a **solo endorsement** must first obtain permission from the **ATC Training Department** before they can be rostered or book the position.  

However, holders of a **permanent rating** may be given priority during the rostering process.

### Event Rostering
For **rostered events**, position assignments are typically managed by the **Marketing Department**. At their discretion, this responsibility may be delegated to another member of the **Arabian vACC Staff team**.

When assigning positions, the following factors are taken into account to ensure the best possible experience for pilots and controllers:

- Previous event experience  
- Recent and total hours on the position  
- Controller feedback  
- Mentoring status  
- Recent disciplinary actions  
- Previous cancellations and no-shows  

The **event roster** is generally published **no later than the night before the event**. However, short-notice changes may occasionally be necessary.

#### Cancellations and No-Shows
All cancellations and no-shows for events are **recorded**. Controllers should **only sign up for an event if they can commit** to attending. In unavoidable circumstances, controllers must notify the **Marketing Department** as soon as possible using both of the methods below:

- **Notify the person responsible for rostering**  
    - Post in the signup forum on Discord **or**  
    - Submit a **Support Ticket** to the Marketing Department

- **Update the original availability post**  
    - Use **strikethrough text** to indicate the change and avoid confusion

If a controller needs to make changes **during the event**, such as leaving early or being unable to attend, they must inform the **Marketing Department**. Leaving a rostered event early may be permitted **only if the minimum staffing for the event can still be maintained**.

#### Violations & Consequences
Violations of the general event guidelines are **monitored** and may result in **disciplinary action** if repeated. Possible consequences include:

- Suspension of **event rostering privileges**  
- Limiting the controller to **open sign-up positions only**  
- Prohibition from **advance sign-ups** for both rostered and non-rostered events

#### Position Booking
For each event, individual controllers for an open-signup event or a designated member of the **Marketing Department** is responsible for booking ATC positions. These positions will be managed through the **upcoming ATC booking system**.
