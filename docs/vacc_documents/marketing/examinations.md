## Scope
Welcome to the **Arabian vACC Examination Guidelines**. This document provides clear standards for the design and presentation of all Arabian vACC event materials, ensuring consistency, professionalism, and alignment with both vACC and VATMENA branding requirements.  

Through consistent application of these rules, the Arabian vACC demonstrates professionalism, strengthens the VATMENA Divisionâ€™s reputation, and provides members with clear, reliable, and visually coherent event communication.  

!!! warning  
    All event branding material and documentation contained in this section is intended solely for use by the Arabian vACC. Unauthorized use, duplication, or modification outside of the vACC is strictly prohibited.  

## General Guidelines
### Banner
When creating a **controller examination banner**, you are strongly encouraged to use the **official template**, available in the **Arabian vACC Google Drive**.  

If you are unable to access or download the template, please contact a **member of the Marketing Department** for assistance.

## Text
The banner template should be followed as **accurately as possible**:  

- The **top line** must display the **position name** and the **airports covered**, written in **ICAO/IATA format**.  
- Below, include the **controllerâ€™s name** and the **exam rating**.  
- For **Tier-1 validations**, you may write *T1* instead of the rating.  
- The **date and time** must be placed at the **bottom of the banner**.  

## Backgrounds
Backgrounds must consist of either:  

- **Community screenshots** related to the **airport being covered**, or  
- A **radar screen background** of the **position in question**.  

## Additional Guidelines
