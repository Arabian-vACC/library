## Scope
This syllabus outlines the structure and learning pathway for students pursuing the S1 rating within the Arabian vACC.

Students will achieve the course objectives through a combination of independent study and guided practical training. Core learning materials are provided via the Moodle platform and the Arabian vACC Library.

In addition to self-study, students will receive one-on-one practical instruction from mentors and instructors. Active participation and engagement are encouraged throughout your training.

Students are also encouraged to ask questions and seek support in the ATC Training category on the Arabian vACC Discord server.

## Grading Criteria
Controllers will be graded during each session with a mentor or instructor. These evaluations are designed using Competency-Based Training and Assessment (CBTA) principles to ensure that controllers are progressing in both skills and knowledge.

### Performance Levels
Controllers will be assessed according to their **competency** and **performance** in each session. The following performance levels exist:

- **Below:** The controller's performance is below the expected standard for their current rating or endorsement.
- **At:** The controller meets the expected standard for their rating or endorsement.
- **Above:** The controller exceeds the expected standard for their rating or endorsement.

Controllers should aim to be **"At"** the expected performance level as they progress through their training. If a controller is rated **"Below,"** additional sessions will be required to address and correct the issues identified during training.

### Input Required from the Mentor or Instructor
In addition to performance evaluation, controllers will be assessed based on the level of input required from the mentor or instructor during the session. This helps identify the controller's ability to operate independently and effectively. The following input levels are used:

- **Constant:** The controller requires frequent reminders throughout the session, indicating a need for further development.
- **Intermittent:** The controller needs occasional reminders, showing progress but still requiring guidance.
- **Minor:** The controller requires very few reminders, indicating good progress and near independence.
- **N/A:** The controller requires no reminders, demonstrating full autonomy in their role.

Controllers should strive for **"N/A"** where no input is required from the mentor or instructor. If a controller is rated as **"Constant,"** additional sessions will be necessary to address gaps in their knowledge or performance.

This grading system helps ensure that controllers receive the support and training they need to meet the required standards for their ratings and endorsements. Continuous feedback and targeted training sessions are crucial for controllers to advance to higher levels of proficiency.
