# Joining Arabian
## Introduction
!!! warning
    Members should only submit a transfer request or seek assignment to a vACC if they are genuinely committed to joining and participating. Requests made without true interest make the process inefficient and unfair to those with genuine intentions..

    **Important:** A 90-day cooldown period applies between transfers. This rule is strictly enforced and cannot be waived.

!!! info
    If you are only interested in flying on VATSIM, you do **not** need to join a vACC. All airspaces and ATC services on the VATSIM network are available to **every** pilot, regardless of vACC membership.
    
    vACC membership is **only required** if you plan to begin **ATC (Air Traffic Control) training**.

Thank you for your interest in joining the Arabian vACC! Before you get started, it’s important to understand how the VATSIM network is organized and how membership assignments work.

This guide is designed to walk you through everything you need to know—step by step. Once you're familiar with the structure, you can move on to the next sections to find the right path based on what you want to do.

### Understanding the VATSIM Structure

VATSIM is organized into three main levels:

1. **Regions**  
   These are the highest-level administrative areas on the network.

2. **Divisions**  
   Each region is divided into multiple divisions, typically based on geography or country groupings.

3. **Subdivisions**  
   Also known as **vACCs** (Virtual Area Control Centers) or **ARTCCs** (Air Route Traffic Control Centers), depending on the region. These represent smaller, local organizations responsible for specific airspace and controller training. **Note:** Not all Divisions have Subdivisions.

The Arabian vACC is part of the VATSIM network and fits into the following structure:

- **The Arabian vACC (ACCARB)** is a Subdivision (vACC) under the Middle East & North Africa Division (**VATMENA**).
- **The Middle East & North Africa Division (VATMENA)** is one of the Divisions within the Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region (**VATEMEA**).
- **The Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region (VATEMEA)** is one of the global Regions that make up the VATSIM network.

All members—whether transferring to the Arabian vACC or applying to control as a visitor—must strictly follow VATSIM's **Transfer and Visiting Controller Policy (TVCP)**.

If you are only interested in visiting (and not transferring), please refer directly to the **Transfer and Visiting Controller Policy** on our Library on the left hand side for detailed instructions and requirements.

## Current vACC/Division/Region Assignment
To proceed with the next sections of this policy, you must first determine your current assignment in terms of vACC, Division, and Region. You can find this information by checking your [myVATSIM profile](https://my.vatsim.net/profile) and looking at the **"Region - Division - Subdivision"** field.

### Region Assignment

After checking your myVATSIM profile, if you are not currently in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region, please follow these steps:

1. Head over to the [myVATSIM Region transfer page](https://my.vatsim.net/user/region).
2. Select **"Europe, Middle East, and Africa"** as your new Region.
3. Select **"Middle East & North Africa"** as your new Division.

!!! Info
    Regional transfers are not managed by the vACC or Division Membership Departments and are outside of our control. Please refrain from messaging us about the status of your transfer, as we are not responsible for these processes. Remember that the VATSIM Transfer & Visiting Controller policy applies, and any approved transfers will be subject to a 90-day cooldown period before you can submit another transfer request.
