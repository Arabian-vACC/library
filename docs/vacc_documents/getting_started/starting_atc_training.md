# Getting Started as an ATC in the Arabian vACC

Looking to become an Air Traffic Controller on the VATSIM Network, controlling one of the Middle East's busiest airspaces? Here's everything you need to know to get started.

## 📌 Requirements & Expectations

Becoming a controller requires:

- Commitment
- Self-study
- A willingness to continuously learn

VATSIM follows a system of graduated ratings that determine the positions you can control, similar to real-world ATC training.

> **Important:** You must be a **resident of the Arabian vACC** before beginning ATC training.

Check your status and how to join here: [Joining Arabian](https://library.arabian-vacc.com/vacc_documents/getting_started/joining_arabian/)

> Joining may take up to 72 hours. Transferring out will remove you from our waiting list and cancel your training eligibility.
