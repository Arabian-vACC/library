## Organization
The Arabian Virtual Area Control Center (referred to as the Arabian vACC or ARBvACC) is a subdivision within the Middle East & North Africa Division (VATMENA) and the Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region (VATEMEA) under the VATSIM Network. Its primary objective is to provide and facilitate air traffic control services on the VATSIM network within the airspaces of Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, striving for excellence in realism with the guiding principles of #ClearVision and #ClearMission.

The Arabian vACC is responsible for the training and staffing of air traffic controllers, ensuring the safe and efficient operation of airspaces in Doha (OTDF), Muscat (OOMM), and the U.A.E (OMAE).

All VATSIM members are required to adhere to the rules and regulations outlined in the VATSIM Code of Conduct and Code of Regulations, which govern the operations of the network.

## Controller Membership
### Transferring Controller
A transfer controller is someone who wishes to permanently move to another vACC. The following rules apply to all transfer requests:

- The controller may hold any ATC rating.
- The controller must follow the Arabian vACC ATC Training Policy.
- Before transferring, the controller must complete at least 50 hours of controlling in their current vACC to consolidate their rating.
- The controller must wait at least 90 days after any rating upgrade or a previous region/division transfer.
- All transfers are subject to the VATSIM Transferring and Visiting Policy.

To apply for a **transfer** to the **Arabian vACC**, please follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the official guide:

### Visting Controller
A visiting controller is someone who wishes to occasionally control in another vACC while keeping their permanent home vACC.

To apply as a **visiting controller** to the **Arabian vACC**, please follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the official guide:

ðŸ‘‰ [**Applying as a Visiting Controller**](https://library.arabian-vacc.com/vacc_documents/getting_started/transfer_and_visiting/)

This guide will walk you through the entire process, from checking your current assignment to submitting a formal transfer request. Be sure to read it carefully to ensure a smooth transition.

### VATMENA Transferring & Visiting Controller Policy
The Arabian vACC follows section 7, 8, and 9 of the VATMENA membership policy in to inbound member transfer requests as well as visiting controller requests. Transfer controllers do not become full division members and visitiors will not be assigned to the ATC roster until the specific criteria has been accomplished. The following details the process transfer and visiting controllers shall take when requesting to transfer or visiting the Arabian vACC.

## Controller Activity
The Arabian vACC is committed to maintaining high-quality control over its airspace, guided by the principles of #ClearVision and #ClearMission. This is achieved by ensuring that all controllers meet the standards set by the vACC and remain up to date with all procedures. As part of this commitment, all controllers within the Arabian vACC are required to log a minimum of **6 hours** of controlling on their **highest approved position** each quarter (**every 3 months**).

### Failure to Achieve the Required Hours
If a controller fails to meet the above requirements, they will be removed from the Arabian vACC roster, and their endorsements will be revoked. A roster cleanup is conducted on the last day of the following months: March, June, September, and December (once per quarter). At least 1-2 weeks before the roster cleanup, a general warning will be issued on the Arabian vACC Discord server, and, when available, via a mass email.

### Leave of Absence
Controllers of the Arabian vACC may request a Leave of Absence (LoA) if they need a break from controlling. The following process applies:

- Submit a support ticket through the Arabian vACC Discord with the subject "Leave of Absence Request."
- A valid reason must be provided. All LoA requests are subject to staff approval.
- LoAs are granted for up to 90 days.
- Controllers on LoA are exempt from the quarterly activity requirement and will be marked as "Not Approved" on the roster.
- If a controller is found actively controlling during their LoA, the leave will be canceled and standard activity rules will apply immediately.
- An LoA can only be renewed once, unless approved in writing by the Membership Director, Deputy Membership Director, or their designee.
- Controllers may update or cancel their LoA by notifying staff.
- After the LoA ends, controllers will return to active status with their previous approvals.
- If the LoA was extended, a mentoring session may be required before resuming normal controlling duties.

### Regaining the Status
#### Resident Controllers
Resident controllers who have been marked as inactive and wish to regain their active status may do so once they are able to commit to the minimum requirements outlined in this policy. To begin this process, the controller must open a support ticket on the Arabian vACC Discord requesting reinstatement. Depending on the length of the inactivity period, a recurrency session may be required before active status is restored.

#### Visiting Controllers
Visiting controllers who have been removed from the Arabian vACC roster may only reapply after a minimum of 30 days has passed since their removal. Upon submitting a new application, and subject to acceptance, the controller must complete at least one recurrency session with a mentor or instructor on the position(s) they were last approved for at the time of removal. Additional mentoring sessions may be required if the mentor or instructor determines that the controller's performance does not meet the expected standards.

New visiting controllers who are actively requesting training sessions are not subject to the activity requirement outlined in this policy. Additionally, visiting controllers who have received their approvals within the current quarter are exempt from these requirements.
