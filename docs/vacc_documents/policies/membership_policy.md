## Organization
The **Arabian Virtual Area Control Center** (hereinafter referred to as **Arabian vACC** or **ARBvACC**) is a recognized subdivision within the **Middle East & North Africa Division (VATMENA)**, operating under the **Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region (VATEMEA)** of the **VATSIM Network**.

The Arabian vACC is responsible for the provision, management, and facilitation of Air Traffic Control (ATC) services on the VATSIM network across the airspaces of **Oman**, **Qatar**, and the **United Arab Emirates**. These services are delivered in accordance with the vACC's guiding values of **#ClearVision** and **#ClearMission**, aiming to uphold a high standard of realism and operational excellence.

As part of its core responsibilities, the Arabian vACC oversees the training and certification of controllers operating within the **Muscat FIR (OOMM)**, **Doha FIR (OTDF)**, and **U.A.E FIR (OMAE)**.

All members of VATSIM are expected to comply with the **VATSIM Code of Conduct** and **Code of Regulations**, which serve as the foundational rules governing behavior and operations across the network.

## Controller Membership
### Transferring Controllers
A **transferring controller** is defined as a VATSIM member seeking a permanent reassignment from their current vACC to the Arabian vACC. The following conditions apply:

- The controller may hold **any ATC rating**.
- A **minimum of 50 hours of controlling** must be logged at the current vACC before applying.
- The controller must have completed any **rating upgrade or previous transfer at least 90 days prior** to the new transfer request.
- The controller must agree to and comply with the **Arabian vACC ATC Training Policy** upon acceptance.
- All transfers must conform to the **VATSIM Transfer and Visiting Controller Policy (TVCP)** and the **VATMENA Membership Policy**.

To initiate a transfer request, please refer to the official guide:

üëâ [**Joining the Arabian vACC**](https://library.arabian-vacc.com/vacc_documents/getting_started/joining_arabian/)

This guide outlines the required steps and documentation for a successful transfer application.

### Visting Controllers
A **visiting controller** is a VATSIM member who retains their primary home vACC but wishes to control within the Arabian vACC on an occasional basis. Visiting controllers must meet the following criteria:

- Applicants must possess an **S2 ATC rating for VATMENA residents** or an **S3 ATC rating for non-VATMENA residents**, in compliance with the **VATSIM Global Controller Administration Policy (GCAP)** and **VATSIM Transfer Visiting Controller Policy (TVCP)**.
- Must comply with the **Arabian vACC Training Policy** and **operational procedures**.
- Acceptance is subject to staff discretion and space availability.

To apply as a visitor, please consult the official visiting controller guide:

üëâ [**Applying as a Visiting Controller**](https://library.arabian-vacc.com/vacc_documents/getting_started/transfer_and_visiting/)

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for submitting your application and preparing for operations within the Arabian vACC.

### VATMENA Transfer and Visiting Policy Alignment
The Arabian vACC abides by Sections **7, 8, and 9** of the **VATMENA Membership Policy** regarding all inbound transfer and visiting controller requests. Please note:

- **Transfer controllers** are not considered full division members until all onboarding and training requirements have been met.
- **Visiting controllers** will not be added to the Arabian vACC ATC roster until all initial approvals and training prerequisites are fulfilled.

## Controller Activity Requirements
To maintain a high level of operational readiness and service, all controllers assigned to the Arabian vACC are required to meet the following **minimum quarterly activity** threshold:

- **6 hours of controlling** must be logged every **three months (quarter)** on the controller‚Äôs **highest approved position**.

This activity requirement supports the Arabian vACC's core values of **#ClearVision** and **#ClearMission**, ensuring service consistency and procedural compliance.

### Non-Compliance and Roster Removals
Controllers who fail to meet the quarterly activity requirement will be:

- Removed from the Arabian vACC roster;
- Have all **endorsements and position approvals revoked**.

**Roster cleanups** are conducted on the final day of March, June, September, and December. A general notice will be issued on the Arabian vACC Discord server and, where possible, by mass email **1‚Äì2 weeks in advance**.

### Leave of Absence (LoA)
Controllers may request a **Leave of Absence (LoA)** if unable to meet activity requirements. The following conditions apply:

- Submit a **support ticket** via the Arabian vACC Discord, titled **"Leave of Absence Request"**.
- Provide a **valid reason** for the request. Approval is subject to staff discretion.
- LoA duration: **up to 90 days**, with **one renewal allowed** unless extended by written approval from the Membership Director or designee.
- Controllers on LoA are exempt from the activity requirement and will be marked as **‚ÄúNot Approved‚Äù** on the roster.
- If a controller is found actively controlling on the network during their LoA, the leave will be **immediately revoked**.

Controllers may **cancel or modify** their LoA by notifying the Membership Department. Upon completion, the controller will return to their previously approved status. A **recurrency session** may be required if the LoA was extended.

### Regaining Active Status
#### Resident Controllers
Controllers removed due to inactivity may request reinstatement once able to meet the required standards. This is done by submitting a **support ticket via Discord**. Depending on the duration of inactivity, a **recurrency session** may be required before active status is restored.

#### Visiting Controllers
Visiting controllers removed for inactivity or other reasons may **reapply after a minimum of 30 days**. Upon re-acceptance:

- At least **one recurrency session** must be completed on the position(s) held at the time of removal.
- Further training may be required if the controller does not meet performance standards.

**Exemptions**:

- New visiting controllers actively engaged in training are exempt from the quarterly activity requirement.
- Visiting controllers approved **within the current quarter** are also exempt.
