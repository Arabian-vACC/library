## Scope
The **Arabian Virtual Area Control Center** (hereinafter referred to as **Arabian vACC** or **ARBvACC**) is an officially recognized subdivision of the **Middle East & North Africa Division (VATMENA)**, operating under the **Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region (VATEMEA)** of the **VATSIM Network**.

The Arabian vACC is responsible for the provision, management, and facilitation of Air Traffic Control (ATC) services across the VATSIM network within the airspaces of **Oman**, **Qatar**, and the **United Arab Emirates**. These services are delivered in alignment with the vACC’s core values of **#ClearVision** and **#ClearMission**, reflecting a commitment to realism and operational excellence.

This policy defines the ATC training procedures for both resident and visiting controllers within the Arabian vACC. It outlines the stages required to progress through the VATSIM rating system and details the procedures followed by training staff, mentors, instructors, examiners, and students.

It supersedes all previous resident and visitor training policies published within the Arabian vACC Library. In case of uncertainty, this document shall be considered the authoritative reference.

### Limitation of Liability
!!! warning
    This policy is intended for use on the VATSIM network only and must not be used for real-world aviation operations. The authors accept no liability for any injury or death resulting from its misuse.

## ATC Training Program
The following section outlines the procedures students must follow to progress through the various VATSIM ratings and how to obtain them.

If a student transfers out of the Arabian vACC—whether on the waiting list or in active ATC training—they must notify the vACC by submitting a support ticket via the Arabian vACC Discord. Students occupying a training slot or place on the waiting list will be removed from both upon transferring to another vACC or Division.

Training resources are limited. Students are advised to carefully consider where they wish to train before committing, to ensure efficient use of available resources and time.

### Generalities
#### Software
##### Controlling Software
All controlling within the Arabian vACC is conducted using the Euroscope controlling client. The Arabian vACC Operations Department manages the sector files for the Doha FIR (OTDF), Muscat FIR (OOMM), and U.A.E FIR (OMAE) on the AeroNav GNG platform, which is accessible through the Euroscope client. These files contain all necessary data for airspace, frequencies, navigation, and other relevant information.

Students can find a comprehensive installation guide at the following links:
* [Euroscope Controlling Client](https://library.arabian-vacc.com/foundations/controller%20software/euroscope/)
* [Audio Clients](https://library.arabian-vacc.com/foundations/controller%20software/audio/)
* [vATIS Client](https://library.arabian-vacc.com/foundations/controller%20software/vatis/)

##### Discord
Discord is the communication platform used by the vACC for members to meet and interact. It features dedicated channels for pilots, controller coordination, training, examinations, and other relevant announcements from the vACC staff. 

!!! info
    Due to U.A.E. laws, VOIP services are currently blocked, meaning members residing in the U.A.E. will not be able to access voice channels. The only way to use these channels is through a VPN (use at your own risk).
