## Scope
Welcome to the Arabian vACC ATC Training Handbook. This document serves as a comprehensive guide for all aspiring and current controllers within the vACC. Whether you are just beginning your journey as a Student Controller or progressing toward Center positions, this handbook will outline the expectations, procedures, and pathways that support your growth and success within the network.

Our training spans three key FIRs across the Middle East: Doha (OTDF), Muscat (OOMM), and the United Arab Emirates (OMAE). Through consistent standards, region-specific procedures, and a focus on real-world accuracy, we aim to deliver a high-quality experience that mirrors real ATC operations while being accessible to all levels of experience.

Our approach balances theory and practice, with a progression system designed to build your skills one rating at a time. This handbook will guide you through that journey â€” from initial onboarding to rating advancement, endorsement acquisition, and beyond.

### Limitation of Liability
