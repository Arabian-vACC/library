## Scope
Welcome to the Arabian vACC ATC Training Policy. This document serves as a comprehensive guide for all aspiring and current controllers within the vACC. Whether you are just beginning your journey as a Student Controller or progressing toward Center positions, this policy will outline the expectations, procedures, and pathways that support your growth and success within the network.

Our training spans three key FIRs across the Middle East: Doha (OTDF), Muscat (OOMM), and the United Arab Emirates (OMAE). Through consistent standards, region-specific procedures, and a focus on real-world accuracy, we aim to deliver a high-quality experience that mirrors real ATC operations while being accessible to all levels of experience.

Our approach balances theory and practice, with a progression system designed to build your skills one rating at a time. This policy will guide you through that journey — from initial onboarding to rating advancement, endorsement acquisition, and beyond.

## Building Blocks for ATC Students
### Software
#### Controller Client
#### Audio Client(s)
#### vATIS Client
#### Discord

### The Waiting List
#### Maintaining Your Spot on the Waiting List
#### Losing Your Spot on the Waiting List
#### Controller Activity

### Training Plan
To be eligible for enrollment in a training plan on Hayya, students must meet the following criteria:

- Be a **resident of the Arabian vACC** and in **good standing**.
- Have successfully completed the **relevant divisional rating exam**.

Controllers seeking to progress beyond the S1 rating must also:

- Be **active on the Arabian vACC Controller Roster**.
- Have accumulated a **minimum of 50 hours** controlling under their current rating.
- Have **no significant negative feedback** on record.

Members are not permitted to reject their assigned training aerodrome, terminal sector, or enroute sector in the expectation of receiving an alternative offer for a preferred position.

Members on the waiting list may be offered a training plan for a specific aerodrome or sector. If the member declines the offer, they may be **removed from the waiting list** at the discretion of the ATC Training Department.

This policy ensures fair and efficient use of training resources and minimizes delays for all members in the training pipeline.

#### Training Facilities Across Arabian vACC FIRs
Training may be conducted within any of the Arabian vACC's three FIRs, with the exception of Tier-1 positions. The available training facilities are as follows:

- **Aerodrome (S1/S2)**
  - Doha-Hamad International Airport (OTHH)
  - Muscat International Airport (OOMS)
  - Sharjah International Airport (OMSJ)
  - Sheikh Zayed International Airport (OMAA)

- **Terminal (S3)**
  - Abu Dhabi TMA (OMAA/OMAD/OMAL)
  - Doha TMA (OTHH/OTBD)
  - Muscat TMA (OOMS)

- **Enroute (C1)**
  - Doha FIR (OTDF)
  - Muscat FIR (OOMS)
  - U.A.E FIR (OMAE)  
    - *Note: Controllers seeking Enroute training within the U.A.E FIR must possess all Tier-1 endorsements. In the absence of these endorsements, training will be limited to the U.A.E South Sector, which excludes the Dubai TMA.*

#### Training Engagement and Availability Expectations
ATC training within the Arabian vACC is a rigorous process. Given the high number of students and the limited number of available mentors and instructors, training resources must be used efficiently. To support this, members enrolled in a training plan are expected to demonstrate consistent engagement and flexibility.

##### Availability Requirements
- **Maintaining Availability**: Students must keep their availability in Hayya up-to-date at all times while holding a position within a training plan.
- **Active Session Requests**: An active session request in Hayya is required at all times. This allows mentors and instructors to identify and accept training opportunities efficiently.
- **Diverse Availability**: Students should aim to provide a wide range of availability—including daytime, evenings, and weekends—where possible. As mentors and instructors may be located in different time zones, flexibility significantly increases the likelihood of receiving training sessions.
- **Session Cancellations**: If a student needs to cancel a scheduled session or withdraw a session request, they must either remove their availability in Hayya or notify their mentor or instructor directly.

##### Leave of Absence
If a student is unable to participate in training for an extended period while enrolled in a training plan, they must notify the Arabian vACC ATC Training Department by submitting a support ticket via the Arabian vACC Discord server. Requests for a break will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The department will make every effort to accommodate personal circumstances, but clear communication is essential.

##### Volunteer Availability and Expectations
Mentors and instructors are volunteers who generously offer their time. While the department aims to provide each student with approximately 2–3 hours of training per week, this is not always possible. All training staff—including department members, instructors, and mentors—volunteer on an ad hoc basis, and availability may vary from week to week. As such, the frequency of training sessions cannot be guaranteed.

##### Recommendations to Improve Training Opportunities
To increase the likelihood of receiving training sessions, students are strongly encouraged to:

- Enter as much availability as possible for the upcoming **14 days**
- Provide availability in **blocks of at least 90 minutes**, with longer periods preferred

#### Training Plan Removal
To ensure fairness to all students awaiting entry into a training plan, spots may be forfeited for reasons under the following conditions:

- The member becomes **inactive on the Arabian vACC roster**.
- The member **fails to maintain availability or submit a session request in Hayya within one week** of receiving a reminder.
- The member **fails to maintain availability or submit a session request after receiving three consecutive reminders**.
- The member **fails to attend three scheduled mentoring sessions** without prior notice (“no-shows”).

##### Discretionary Removal
The ATC Training Department Director reserves the right to remove a member from a training plan at their discretion in circumstances including, but not limited to:

- **Consistent lack of progress** compared to expected training milestones.
- **Lack of engagement** with the training course or communication with training staff.
- **Disciplinary action** taken against the member.
- **Repeated negative feedback** while controlling positions the member is already rated for.

All forfeiture decisions will be made in alignment with the broader goals of maintaining fairness, efficiency, and high standards across the training program.


### Self-Study
Students are expected to engage with the theoretical content provided in the (Arabian vACC Library)[https://library.arabian-vacc.com] outside of their scheduled mentoring sessions. This includes, but is not limited to, reviewing assigned readings, practicing relevant skills, and deepening their understanding of core concepts. Mentors and instructors may also suggest additional resources or encourage observation of experienced controllers.

After each mentoring session, mentors and instructors will provide comprehensive feedback. It is the student's responsibility to carefully review these reports and address any areas highlighted by the mentor for improvement. This may involve independent study on certain topics or revisiting specific techniques. Research consistently shows that students who actively engage with feedback and make necessary adjustments tend to progress more rapidly through training and perform better on exams.

Arriving unprepared for a session—whether through a lack of review of session reports or theoretical material—is considered unprofessional. Mentors and instructors are within their rights to end a session prematurely if they feel that the student has not made adequate efforts to prepare. In such cases, a report will be submitted to the ATC Training Department Director for further review. This may lead to the student's removal from the training plan if insufficient progress or engagement is noted.

### Asking for Help
In aviation, there are no "stupid" questions—it's always better to ask than to remain silent. The ATC Training Department staff, instructors, and mentors are always available and happy to assist students with any questions related to their training. Students are encouraged to direct their questions to the #training-text channel on the Arabian vACC Discord.

### Attending a Mentoring Session
Mentoring sessions will be conducted via the (Arabian vACC Discord Server)[https://community.vatsim.net/], which offers the ability to use screen-sharing when necessary. Students should join the waiting room promptly, fully prepared with their controlling software configured and any necessary resources at hand, ready to begin the session as soon as their mentor or instructor moves them into the training room.

Due to local regulations in the U.A.E, where VOIP services like Discord are blocked, students residing in the U.A.E will not be able to conduct their sessions through Discord. In such cases, an alternative communication platform may be used, subject to agreement between the student and their mentor or instructor. While it is possible to use a VPN to bypass these restrictions, the Arabian vACC does not support or endorse the use of VPNs.

### Solo Validations
In accordance with the Middle East & North Africa Division ATC Training Policy, the Arabian vACC is responsible for issuing solo validations for students working toward their tower, approach, and center ratings. The responsibility for these validations lies with the assigned mentor or instructor. The following solo validations may be granted:

- **Tower:**
  - Available to Arabian vACC residents training for S2.
  - Granted for the position where the student's training has taken place.
  - Valid for up to 90 days.
- **Approach:**
  - Available to Arabian vACC residents training for S3.
  - Granted for the position where the student's training has taken place.
  - Valid for up to 90 days.
- **Center:**
  - Available to Arabian vACC residents training for C1.
  - Granted for the position where the student's training has taken place.
  - Valid for up to 90 days.

Solo validations will only be granted for a maximum of 30 days at a time before a practical exam is required. If a student does not pass the exam, they may continue to operate under a solo validation after receiving additional mentoring sessions. Students holding a solo validation are authorized to control at any time on their assigned training position, including during events, without the presence of a mentor.

### Examinations
#### Theoretical
All theoretical modules and exams for the S1, S2, S3, and C1 ratings are available through the (Middle East & North Africa Academy)[https://academy.vatsim.me]. Completion of these modules and exams is required to be eligible for enrollment in a training plan.

#### Practical
When a student, in agreement with their mentor or instructor, feels ready, they can submit a request for an examination through the ATC Training Department. Before being forwarded for a practical exam, students will be consulted to ensure they are fully prepared, and additional training can be arranged if requested by the student. 

For S2 exams, there will be one local examiner present. S3 and C1 exams will have both a divisional examiner and a local examiner in attendance.

All exams are open-book. Students are encouraged to use any available resources to assist in answering questions. Examiners prefer that students know where to find information rather than guess. However, students are prohibited from soliciting answers from others on the network. Any attempt to do so will result in an automatic failure of the exam.

Exams typically last no more than 90 minutes, followed by a debrief with the examiners to ensure the exam process is concluded.

The possible outcomes of the exam are as follows:

- Pass
- Incomplete (to be continued at a later date)
- Fail

An exam will not be marked as a pass if:

- Any competency is marked as fail or not assessed.
- Three or more competencies are marked as inadequate.

If the student passes the exam, the result will be posted on the Arabian vACC Discord, and the rating will be issued within 48 hours after the exam report has been submitted. If the exam is marked as incomplete, the request will be retained, and the exam will be continued with either the same or different examiners at a later date. 

In the event of a failure, the examiners will conduct a thorough debrief and create a remedial training plan, which will be forwarded to the student's mentor or instructor.

### Fast-Track Program
In accordance with the Middle East & North Africa Division ATC Training Policy, the Arabian vACC offers a fast-track program for members who hold real-world ATC licenses or wish to transfer their rating from IVAO. To begin this process, members must submit a support ticket on the Arabian vACC Discord server, providing proof of their real-world license (with any sensitive information redacted as necessary) or their IVAO profile.

All members participating in the fast-track program are still required to complete the relevant theoretical exams for the rating they are pursuing. Upon successfully passing these exams, they will proceed with the standard mentoring sessions before being issued their rating.
