## Scope
The **Arabian Virtual Area Control Center** (hereinafter referred to as **Arabian vACC** or **ARBvACC**) is a recognized subdivision within the **Middle East & North Africa Division (VATMENA)**, operating under the **Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region (VATEMEA)** of the **VATSIM Network**.

The Arabian vACC is responsible for the provision, management, and facilitation of Air Traffic Control (ATC) services on the VATSIM network across the airspaces of **Oman**, **Qatar**, and the **United Arab Emirates**. These services are delivered in accordance with the vACC's guiding values of **#ClearVision** and **#ClearMission**, aiming to uphold a high standard of realism and operational excellence.

As part of its core responsibilities, the Arabian vACC oversees the operations of air traffic controllers within the **Muscat FIR (OOMM)**, **Doha FIR (OTDF)**, and **U.A.E FIR (OMAE)**.

All members of VATSIM are expected to comply with the **VATSIM Code of Conduct** and **Code of Regulations**, which serve as the foundational rules governing behavior and operations across the network.

## Controllers
### Controller Conduct

All controllers within the Arabian vACC are expected to uphold the highest level of professionalism and adhere to the following standards at all times:

- **Adherence to VATSIM Regulations**  
  All controllers must strictly comply with the VATSIM Code of Conduct and Code of Regulations.

- **Good Standing Requirement**  
  Controllers must be in good standing with the Arabian vACC, VATMENA, VATEMEA, and the VATSIM network.

- **Violation Consequences**  
  Any controller found, after proper investigation, to have violated any provision of the VATSIM Code of Conduct—whether acting as a controller, pilot, or observer—will be **immediately removed from the Arabian vACC roster**. No prior notice will be required for such removal.

- **Compliance with Policies and Procedures**  
  Controllers are required to comply with all applicable Arabian vACC training standards, policies, and documentation, including but not limited to:  
  - The Arabian vACC Training System  
  - SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures)  
  - vMATS (Virtual Manual of Air Traffic Services)  
  - Operational Changes  
  - Letters of Agreement (LoAs)

- **Zero Tolerance for Misconduct**  
  Any form of hate speech, violent behavior, derogatory remarks, or personal attacks directed at pilots or fellow controllers will result in **immediate and permanent removal from the Arabian vACC**. Additionally, such incidents will be reported to the VATSIM network for further action.

Failure to comply with the conduct expectations outlined in this section may result in disciplinary action, up to and including removal of controlling privileges within the Arabian vACC.

---

### Training Standards

The Arabian vACC is dedicated to maintaining realism and excellence in ATC operations.

- **Adherence to Official Procedures**  
  Controllers must strictly follow procedures as outlined in:  
  - Arabian vMATS  
  - Published SOPs  
  - Operational Changes  
  - Letters of Agreement (LoAs)

- **Training Policy Compliance**  
  All controllers must adhere to:  
  - The Arabian vACC Policy on Training Process for Home and Visiting Controllers  
  - The Arabian vACC Policy on Activity Requirements

Non-compliance may result in disciplinary action and/or restriction of training or controlling privileges.

---

### Spoken Language Requirement

- **English Proficiency**  
  In accordance with ICAO standards, English is the required language for all controller-pilot communication on the VATSIM network.

- **Use of Standard Phraseology**  
  Controllers must use ICAO-standard phraseology at all times, as outlined in the **Arabian Radiotelephony Manual**.

---

### Controller Availability and Staffing

- **Full Staffing Requirement**  
  Controllers must remain at their position and actively monitor their station for the entire duration of their session.

- **Temporary Absences**  
  If a controller needs to step away for more than **5 minutes**, they are required to disconnect from the network. Reconnection should only occur once they are able to resume full control duties.

- **Session Termination**  
  Prior to disconnecting, controllers must follow the coordination procedure described in the **"Ending a Session"** section of this policy.

---

### Streaming While Controlling

- **Primary Duty**  
  Controllers who choose to stream their controlling session on any online platform must **prioritize their ATC duties** over all stream-related interactions (chat, alerts, etc.).

- **Consent and Notification**  
  Controllers intending to stream must:  
  - Notify fellow controllers in the **Discord coordination channel**, and  
  - Obtain their consent before streaming in shared voice channels.  

  If consent is not granted, the streaming controller must relocate to a separate Discord channel to avoid disrupting coordination.

### Minimum Session Time

The Arabian vACC is dedicated to delivering consistent, high-quality service to pilots flying in the Arabian region. To maintain this standard, controllers must adhere to the minimum session time requirements outlined below.

Controllers, regardless of their membership status, are not permitted to log on for an ATC session that falls short of the specified minimum durations. **Any sessions lasting less than 30 minutes will not be counted** towards the controller's quarterly total.

| Position | Minimum Session Time |
|:--------:|:--------------------:|
|  DEL/GND |      30 Minutes      |
|    TWR   |      30 Minutes      |
|  DEP/APP |      30 Minutes      |
|    CTR   |      30 Minutes      |

For example, if a controller logs a total of 8 hours in a quarter but one session lasted only 28 minutes, that session will be deducted from the 8-hour total.

Exceptions may be made in the event of technical issues beyond the member's control. In such cases, the controller must **notify any other online controllers as soon as possible** after a disconnection or technical failure.

Controllers who are unable to meet the minimum session time requirement should refrain from logging on to control. **Persistent failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action or suspension of controller privileges**.

## Controller Coordination
#### Commencing a session
Controllers must not open any ATC position within the Arabian vACC without first completing the required coordination procedures as outlined below.

``` mermaid
flowchart LR
   a[Controller checks out VATSIM Radar or equivalent to see if ATC is online] --> b[Adjacent controllers are online] --> c[Log on as an Observer] --> d[Coordinate with the next controller to determine ATIS, runways in use, and operational info] --> e[Log on desired position]
    a[Controller checks out VATSIM Radar or equivalent to see if ATC is online] --> f[Adjacent controllers are not online] --> e[Log on desired position]
```

Controllers must check the Arabian vACC Discord server to determine if adjacent controllers are present in a designated Coordination voice channel. If present, coordination must take place through this voice channel prior to opening an adjacent position.

When logging in as an observer, controllers are required to allow adequate time for EuroScope to refresh the online ATC list and verify that their visibility center is correctly configured. Failure to do so will be treated as a failure to coordinate.

!!! warning
    Controllers must be present in either a general or coordination voice channel—preferably on the Arabian vACC Discord server—while controlling, and must remain reachable at all times for coordination purposes.

---

### Use of Relief Callsigns
Controllers connecting to relieve another controller during peak hours or scheduled events must log on to the VATSIM network using an appropriate relief callsign. The relief callsign must include the letter “R” before the suffix (e.g., `OMDB_R1_TWR`, `OMDW_R_APP`, `OTDF_R1_CTR`).

This procedure allows the relieving controller to observe current traffic on the scope, properly configure their controller client, set up ATIS and Audio for VATSIM connections, and prepare for a seamless transition.

Use of a relief callsign also ensures that all transceivers linked to the position are correctly loaded and operational.

### Discord Support Roles
Controllers may "subscribe" to specific roles on the Arabian vACC Discord server to receive notifications whenever those roles are used for the following purposes outlined below.

#### ATC Event Requests
The following role is used by the Arabian vACC Marketing Department to request controllers to express their interest in specific positions for upcoming events.

#### ATC Support Requests
Controllers working top-down or handling excessive traffic may use this role to request support from lower-level controllers. This role is intended for situations where a controller is managing high-level traffic and requires assistance from a lower controller at a specific location.

For example, a controller managing Dubai Arrivals while also handling traffic on the ground at multiple airports (e.g., Al-Maktoum, Dubai, and Sharjah) may use this role to request support from aerodrome controllers.

An example message utilizing this role is as follows:

`@ATC Support Requests, Currently on OMDB_APP covering OMDB, OMDW, and OMSJ top-down with traffic on the ground. Would appreciate any aerodrome controllers.`

#### ATC Relief Requests
Controllers planning to leave their position but whose departure would cause significant disruption should use this role. This includes situations where closing the position would increase the workload of a higher-level position within the top-down hierarchy.

For example, if you are on tower handling 12 departures and closing the position would significantly impact the approach or center controller's workload, this role should be used.

An example message utilizing this role is as follows:

`@ATC Relief Requests, About to leave OTHH_1_TWR in 10 minutes, 10 aircraft on the ground with no DEL/GND with a busy OTDF_1_CTR above. Aerodrome relief would be appreciated.`
