## Scope

The **Arabian Virtual Area Control Center** (hereinafter referred to as **Arabian vACC** or **ARBvACC**) is a recognized subdivision within the **Middle East & North Africa Division (VATMENA)**, operating under the **Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region (VATEMEA)** of the **VATSIM Network**.

The Arabian vACC is responsible for providing, managing, and facilitating Air Traffic Control (ATC) services on the VATSIM network across the airspaces of **Oman**, **Qatar**, and the **United Arab Emirates**. These services are provided in accordance with the vACC's guiding values of **#ClearVision** and **#ClearMission**, aiming to maintain a high standard of realism and operational excellence.

The Arabian vACC oversees air traffic controller operations in the **Muscat FIR (OOMM)**, **Doha FIR (OTDF)**, and **U.A.E FIR (OMAE)**.

All VATSIM members are expected to comply with the **VATSIM Code of Conduct** and **Code of Regulations**, which govern behavior and operations across the network.

### Controller Availability and Staffing

- **Consent and Notification**  
  Controllers intending to stream must:  
    - Notify fellow controllers in the **Discord coordination channel**  
    - Obtain consent from them before streaming in shared voice channels.

If consent is denied, the streaming controller must move to a separate Discord channel to avoid disrupting coordination.

Sessions under 30 minutes will not be counted toward the controller's quarterly total. Repeated non-compliance may lead to disciplinary action.

---

## Controller Bookings

### General

The [Arabian vACC ATC Booking System (Coming Soonâ„¢)](https://arabian-vacc.com) allows rated Resident or Visitor controllers to book ATC positions within the vACC. Bookings are also submitted to the VATSIM ATC system.

### Booking a Position

Controllers may only book positions they are authorized for or have received permission from an instructor/mentor to book ahead of a mentoring session.

### ATC Booking Rules

Controllers must adhere to the following rules:

- An ATC booking does not grant the member control of the position.
- Controllers must comply with [VATSIM Code of Conduct: Section C5](https://vatsim.net/docs/policy/code-of-conduct).
- All members must respect each other's bookings.
- Only controllers rated Student 1 (S1) or higher may submit a booking.
- Event bookings follow a different procedure and must not be made through this system.
- Controllers should avoid repeatedly booking the same positions.

### Controllers Not Showing Up for a Booked Position

Controllers must fulfill their bookings. If unable to attend, they must cancel their booking. Repeated no-shows may result in the revocation of booking privileges.

---

## Controller Bookings During Events

### General

The Arabian vACC uses the VATSIM ATC booking system for event bookings. This system ensures uninterrupted ATC services for participating pilots.

### Expression of Interest

Controllers express interest in events via the Arabian vACC Discord forum.

#### Expression of Interest Rules
* Controllers may only express interest for positions they are authorized to control.
* Expressions of interest must be made exclusively through Discord.
* Positions may be re-assigned based on event needs.
* Controllers will be prioritized for events they have not participated in recently.

### Event Roster
The roster is posted in the "rostering" channel on Discord at least 3 hours before the event starts. Controllers will be confirmed in the VATSIM ATC system.

### Controllers Unable to Attend Their Rostered Slot

Controllers must notify the Arabian vACC Marketing Director or Deputy Director if they cannot attend their rostered slot. Failure to do so repeatedly may result in exclusion from future events.

### Controllers Not Showing Up for a Rostered Position

Controllers are required to fulfill all assigned rostered positions. In the event of an unavoidable absence, timely notification is mandatory. Repeated unexcused absences may lead to removal from future event rosters.

!!! warning
    Participants who fail to attend CPTs without a valid reason will be subject to an immediate suspension from participating in the next three events.

### Event Briefings

Controllers must attend the event briefing 15 minutes before the event, which will cover hot topics, weather, and special procedures.

---

## Controller Coordination

### Commencing a Session

Controllers must complete coordination procedures before opening any position. They must check the Arabian vACC Discord server to see if adjacent controllers are present in coordination channels.

``` mermaid
flowchart LR
   a[Controller checks out VATSIM Radar or equivalent to see if ATC is online] --> b[Adjacent controllers are online] --> c[Log on as an Observer] --> d[Coordinate with the next controller to determine ATIS, runways in use, and operational info] --> e[Log on desired position]
    a[Controller checks out VATSIM Radar or equivalent to see if ATC is online] --> f[Adjacent controllers are not online] --> e[Log on desired position]
```

---

### Discord presence

For coordination purposes, at times when two or more adjacent controllers are online within Arabian vACC, controllers **should** remain present on Discord, to allow for smoother coordination.
During events, controllers **shall** remain present on Discord in relevant coordination channels, to allow for smoother coordination among adjacent controllers. 

!!! info
    A future solution is in the works by the Operations Department, to allow a more optimised technical coordination solution. 

---

### Use of Relief Callsigns

Controllers relieving others during peak hours must use a relief callsign (e.g., `OMDB_R1_TWR`) to ensure proper transition and avoid disruption.

---

### Discord Support Roles
Controllers may "subscribe" to specific roles on the Arabian vACC Discord server to receive notifications whenever those roles are used for the following purposes outlined below.

#### ATC Event Requests
The following role is used by the Arabian vACC Marketing Department to request controllers to express their interest in specific positions for upcoming events.

#### ATC Support Requests
Controllers working top-down or handling excessive traffic may use this role to request support from lower-level controllers. This role is intended for situations where a controller is managing high-level traffic and requires assistance from a lower controller at a specific location.

For example, a controller managing Dubai Arrivals while also handling traffic on the ground at multiple airports (e.g., Al-Maktoum, Dubai, and Sharjah) may use this role to request support from aerodrome controllers.

!!! example
    @ATC Support Requests, Currently on OMDB_APP covering OMDB, OMDW, and OMSJ top-down with traffic on the ground. Would appreciate any aerodrome controllers.

#### ATC Relief Requests
Controllers planning to leave their position but whose departure would cause significant disruption should use this role. This includes situations where closing the position would increase the workload of a higher-level position within the top-down hierarchy.

For example, if you are on tower handling 12 departures and closing the position would significantly impact the approach or center controller's workload, this role should be used.

!!! example
    @ATC Relief Requests, About to leave OTHH_1_TWR in 10 minutes, 10 aircraft on the ground with no DEL/GND with a busy OTDF_1_CTR above. Aerodrome relief would be appreciated.

---

### Ending a Session

Controllers must notify others of their intent to disconnect using the `.break` function on EuroScope and announce it via voice at least 5 minutes before disconnecting.

---

## Conflict Resolution

In case of conflict, controllers should contact the vACC Director or Deputy Director for informal resolution. If unresolved, the matter may be escalated to the Division Director or DCRM for further action.

---

### Reporting Issues

Controllers can report non-compliance via [this form](https://vats.im/arb/feedback).

---

## Non-compliance with this Policy

Ignorance of policies is not an acceptable defense. It is each memberâ€™s responsibility to stay informed of the latest procedures. Repeated violations may result in the revocation of approvals or sign-offs.
